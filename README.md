# La Comedia

## Goals
La Comedia provides a rich, high resolution, viewing experience, and open access
to Botticelli's Illustrations of Dante's Divine Comedy, enhanced with annotations that link
Botticelli's illustration to Dante's Comedy, both in his language and those of the viewer.

## Usage
At present, La Comedia is entirely client-side-rendered with OpenSeaDragon, and a set of
DeepZoom files, described by JSON. I am looking for a good way to host this large (4GiB) and
numbered (~60,000 files) fileset freely for others to set up their own instances, but until then
you should visit my instance at [https://davidgumberg.github.io/lacomedia/](https://davidgumberg.github.io/lacomedia/)

## Copyright and Image Sources
- Nearly all of the illustrations come from Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, which has generously donated their images
to the Public Domain with the Creative Commons PDM 1.0, and made [available online.](https://recherche.smb.museum/)
- Those illustrations not available through the SMB, namely the diagram of Inferno,
Inferno I, Inferno IX through XVI, and Purgatorio I[^1] come from facsimiles produced
for the 1896 printing of ['Drawings by Sandro Botticelli for Dante's Divina Commedia'](https://archive.org/details/drawingsbysandro00bott)
and are in the Public Domain in the United States due to their age.
 
[^1]: Purgatorio I is in the SMB's collection but without an available image at present.
