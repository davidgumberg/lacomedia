<div class="canto" id="CantoI.I">
<p>
Midway upon the journey of our life<br>
    I found myself within a forest dark,<br>
    For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
</p>
<p>
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br>
    What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br>
    Which in the very thought renews the fear.
</p>
<p>
So bitter is it, death is little more;<br>
    But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br>
    Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
</p>
<p>
I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br>
    So full was I of slumber at the moment<br>
    In which I had abandoned the true way.
</p>
<p>
But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,<br>
    At that point where the valley terminated,<br>
    Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
</p>
<p>
Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,<br>
    Vested already with that planet’s rays<br>
    Which leadeth others right by every road.
</p>
<p>
Then was the fear a little quieted<br>
    That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout<br>
    The night, which I had passed so piteously.
</p>
<p>
And even as he, who, with distressful breath,<br>
    Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,<br>
    Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
</p>
<p>
So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,<br>
    Turn itself back to re-behold the pass<br>
    Which never yet a living person left.
</p>
<p>
After my weary body I had rested,<br>
    The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br>
    So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
</p>
<p>
And lo! almost where the ascent began,<br>
    A panther light and swift exceedingly,<br>
    Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!
</p>
<p>
And never moved she from before my face,<br>
    Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br>
    That many times I to return had turned.
</p>
<p>
The time was the beginning of the morning,<br>
    And up the sun was mounting with those stars<br>
    That with him were, what time the Love Divine
</p>
<p>
At first in motion set those beauteous things;<br>
    So were to me occasion of good hope,<br>
    The variegated skin of that wild beast,
</p>
<p>
The hour of time, and the delicious season;<br>
    But not so much, that did not give me fear<br>
    A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.
</p>
<p>
He seemed as if against me he were coming<br>
    With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,<br>
    So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
</p>
<p>
And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<br>
    Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,<br>
    And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
</p>
<p>
She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br>
    With the affright that from her aspect came,<br>
    That I the hope relinquished of the height.
</p>
<p>
And as he is who willingly acquires,<br>
    And the time comes that causes him to lose,<br>
    Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
</p>
<p>
E’en such made me that beast withouten peace,<br>
    Which, coming on against me by degrees<br>
    Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.
</p>
<p>
While I was rushing downward to the lowland,<br>
    Before mine eyes did one present himself,<br>
    Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
</p>
<p>
When I beheld him in the desert vast,<br>
    “Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,<br>
    “Whiche’er thou art, or shade or real man!”
</p>
<p>
He answered me: “Not man; man once I was,<br>
    And both my parents were of Lombardy,<br>
    And Mantuans by country both of them.
</p>
<p>
‘Sub Julio’ was I born, though it was late,<br>
    And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,<br>
    During the time of false and lying gods.
</p>
<p>
A poet was I, and I sang that just<br>
    Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,<br>
    After that Ilion the superb was burned.
</p>
<p>
But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br>
    Why climb’st thou not the Mount Delectable,<br>
    Which is the source and cause of every joy?”
</p>
<p>
“Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<br>
    Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?”<br>
    I made response to him with bashful forehead.
</p>
<p>
“O, of the other poets honour and light,<br>
    Avail me the long study and great love<br>
    That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
</p>
<p>
Thou art my master, and my author thou,<br>
    Thou art alone the one from whom I took<br>
    The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
</p>
<p>
Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;<br>
    Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,<br>
    For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.”
</p>
<p>
“Thee it behoves to take another road,”<br>
    Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,<br>
    “If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
</p>
<p>
Because this beast, at which thou criest out,<br>
    Suffers not any one to pass her way,<br>
    But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
</p>
<p>
And has a nature so malign and ruthless,<br>
    That never doth she glut her greedy will,<br>
    And after food is hungrier than before.
</p>
<p>
Many the animals with whom she weds,<br>
    And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<br>
    Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.
</p>
<p>
He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,<br>
    But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;<br>
    ’Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
</p>
<p>
Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<br>
    On whose account the maid Camilla died,<br>
    Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
</p>
<p>
Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br>
    Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br>
    There from whence envy first did let her loose.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br>
    Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br>
    And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
</p>
<p>
Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br>
    Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br>
    Who cry out each one for the second death;
</p>
<p>
And thou shalt see those who contented are<br>
    Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br>
    Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;
</p>
<p>
To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br>
    A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br>
    With her at my departure I will leave thee;
</p>
<p>
Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br>
    In that I was rebellious to his law,<br>
    Wills that through me none come into his city.
</p>
<p>
He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;<br>
    There is his city and his lofty throne;<br>
    O happy he whom thereto he elects!”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,<br>
    By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br>
    So that I may escape this woe and worse,
</p>
<p>
Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br>
    That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br>
    And those thou makest so disconsolate.”
</p>
<p>
Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.II">
<p>
Day was departing, and the embrowned air<br>
    Released the animals that are on earth<br>
    From their fatigues; and I the only one
</p>
<p>
Made myself ready to sustain the war,<br>
    Both of the way and likewise of the woe,<br>
    Which memory that errs not shall retrace.
</p>
<p>
O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!<br>
    O memory, that didst write down what I saw,<br>
    Here thy nobility shall be manifest!
</p>
<p>
And I began: “Poet, who guidest me,<br>
    Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,<br>
    Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.  </p>
<p>
Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,<br>
    While yet corruptible, unto the world<br>
    Immortal went, and was there bodily.
</p>
<p>
But if the adversary of all evil<br>
    Was courteous, thinking of the high effect<br>
    That issue would from him, and who, and what,
</p>
<p>
To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;<br>
    For he was of great Rome, and of her empire<br>
    In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;
</p>
<p>
The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,<br>
    Were stablished as the holy place, wherein<br>
    Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.
</p>
<p>
Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,<br>
    Things did he hear, which the occasion were<br>
    Both of his victory and the papal mantle.
</p>
<p>
Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<br>
    To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,<br>
    Which of salvation’s way is the beginning.
</p>
<p>
But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?<br>
    I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,<br>
    Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if I resign myself to come,<br>
    I fear the coming may be ill-advised;<br>
    Thou’rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.”
</p>
<p>
And as he is, who unwills what he willed,<br>
    And by new thoughts doth his intention change,<br>
    So that from his design he quite withdraws,
</p>
<p>
Such I became, upon that dark hillside,<br>
    Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,<br>
    Which was so very prompt in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
“If I have well thy language understood,”<br>
    Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,<br>
    “Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,
</p>
<p>
Which many times a man encumbers so,<br>
    It turns him back from honoured enterprise,<br>
    As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.
</p>
<p>
That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,<br>
    I’ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard<br>
    At the first moment when I grieved for thee.
</p>
<p>
Among those was I who are in suspense,<br>
    And a fair, saintly Lady called to me<br>
    In such wise, I besought her to command me.
</p>
<p>
Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<br>
    And she began to say, gentle and low,<br>
    With voice angelical, in her own language:
</p>
<p>
‘O spirit courteous of Mantua,<br>
    Of whom the fame still in the world endures,<br>
    And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;
</p>
<p>
A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,<br>
    Upon the desert slope is so impeded<br>
    Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,
</p>
<p>
And may, I fear, already be so lost,<br>
    That I too late have risen to his succour,<br>
    From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.
</p>
<p>
Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<br>
    And with what needful is for his release,<br>
    Assist him so, that I may be consoled.
</p>
<p>
Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<br>
    I come from there, where I would fain return;<br>
    Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.
</p>
<p>
When I shall be in presence of my Lord,<br>
    Full often will I praise thee unto him.’<br>
    Then paused she, and thereafter I began:
</p>
<p>
‘O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom<br>
    The human race exceedeth all contained<br>
    Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,
</p>
<p>
So grateful unto me is thy commandment,<br>
    To obey, if ’twere already done, were late;<br>
    No farther need’st thou ope to me thy wish.
</p>
<p>
But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun<br>
    The here descending down into this centre,<br>
    From the vast place thou burnest to return to.’
</p>
<p>
‘Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,<br>
    Briefly will I relate,’ she answered me,<br>
    ‘Why I am not afraid to enter here.
</p>
<p>
Of those things only should one be afraid<br>
    Which have the power of doing others harm;<br>
    Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.
</p>
<p>
God in his mercy such created me<br>
    That misery of yours attains me not,<br>
    Nor any flame assails me of this burning.
</p>
<p>
A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<br>
    At this impediment, to which I send thee,<br>
    So that stern judgment there above is broken.
</p>
<p>
In her entreaty she besought Lucia,<br>
    And said, “Thy faithful one now stands in need<br>
    Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.”
</p>
<p>
Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,<br>
    Hastened away, and came unto the place<br>
    Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.
</p>
<p>
“Beatrice” said she, “the true praise of God,<br>
    Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,<br>
    For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?
</p>
<p>
Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?<br>
    Dost thou not see the death that combats him<br>
    Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?”
</p>
<p>
Never were persons in the world so swift<br>
    To work their weal and to escape their woe,<br>
    As I, after such words as these were uttered,
</p>
<p>
Came hither downward from my blessed seat,<br>
    Confiding in thy dignified discourse,<br>
    Which honours thee, and those who’ve listened to it.’
</p>
<p>
After she thus had spoken unto me,<br>
    Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;<br>
    Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;
</p>
<p>
And unto thee I came, as she desired;<br>
    I have delivered thee from that wild beast,<br>
    Which barred the beautiful mountain’s short ascent.
</p>
<p>
What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?<br>
    Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?<br>
    Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,
</p>
<p>
Seeing that three such Ladies benedight<br>
    Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,<br>
    And so much good my speech doth promise thee?”
</p>
<p>
Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<br>
    Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,<br>
    Uplift themselves all open on their stems;
</p>
<p>
Such I became with my exhausted strength,<br>
    And such good courage to my heart there coursed,<br>
    That I began, like an intrepid person:
</p>
<p>
“O she compassionate, who succoured me,<br>
    And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon<br>
    The words of truth which she addressed to thee!
</p>
<p>
Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed<br>
    To the adventure, with these words of thine,<br>
    That to my first intent I have returned.
</p>
<p>
Now go, for one sole will is in us both,<br>
    Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.”<br>
    Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,
</p>
<p>
I entered on the deep and savage way.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.III">
<p>
“Through me the way is to the city dolent;<br>
    Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br>
    Through me the way among the people lost.
</p>
<p>
Justice incited my sublime Creator;<br>
    Created me divine Omnipotence,<br>
    The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.
</p>
<p>
Before me there were no created things,<br>
    Only eterne, and I eternal last.<br>
    All hope abandon, ye who enter in!”
</p>
<p>
These words in sombre colour I beheld<br>
    Written upon the summit of a gate;<br>
    Whence I: “Their sense is, Master, hard to me!”
</p>
<p>
And he to me, as one experienced:<br>
    “Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,<br>
    All cowardice must needs be here extinct.
</p>
<p>
We to the place have come, where I have told thee<br>
    Thou shalt behold the people dolorous<br>
    Who have foregone the good of intellect.”
</p>
<p>
And after he had laid his hand on mine<br>
    With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,<br>
    He led me in among the secret things.
</p>
<p>
There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud<br>
    Resounded through the air without a star,<br>
    Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.
</p>
<p>
Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br>
    Accents of anger, words of agony,<br>
    And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,
</p>
<p>
Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br>
    For ever in that air for ever black,<br>
    Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.
</p>
<p>
And I, who had my head with horror bound,<br>
    Said: “Master, what is this which now I hear?<br>
    What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “This miserable mode<br>
    Maintain the melancholy souls of those<br>
    Who lived withouten infamy or praise.
</p>
<p>
Commingled are they with that caitiff choir<br>
    Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,<br>
    Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.
</p>
<p>
The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;<br>
    Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,<br>
    For glory none the damned would have from them.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “O Master, what so grievous is<br>
    To these, that maketh them lament so sore?”<br>
    He answered: “I will tell thee very briefly.
</p>
<p>
These have no longer any hope of death;<br>
    And this blind life of theirs is so debased,<br>
    They envious are of every other fate.
</p>
<p>
No fame of them the world permits to be;<br>
    Misericord and Justice both disdain them.<br>
    Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.”
</p>
<p>
And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,<br>
    Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,<br>
    That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;
</p>
<p>
And after it there came so long a train<br>
    Of people, that I ne’er would have believed<br>
    That ever Death so many had undone.
</p>
<p>
When some among them I had recognised,<br>
    I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<br>
    Who made through cowardice the great refusal.
</p>
<p>
Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,<br>
    That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches<br>
    Hateful to God and to his enemies.
</p>
<p>
These miscreants, who never were alive,<br>
    Were naked, and were stung exceedingly<br>
    By gadflies and by hornets that were there.
</p>
<p>
These did their faces irrigate with blood,<br>
    Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet<br>
    By the disgusting worms was gathered up.
</p>
<p>
And when to gazing farther I betook me.<br>
    People I saw on a great river’s bank;<br>
    Whence said I: “Master, now vouchsafe to me,
</p>
<p>
That I may know who these are, and what law<br>
    Makes them appear so ready to pass over,<br>
    As I discern athwart the dusky light.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “These things shall all be known<br>
    To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay<br>
    Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.”
</p>
<p>
Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,<br>
    Fearing my words might irksome be to him,<br>
    From speech refrained I till we reached the river.
</p>
<p>
And lo! towards us coming in a boat<br>
    An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,<br>
    Crying: “Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!
</p>
<p>
Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;<br>
    I come to lead you to the other shore,<br>
    To the eternal shades in heat and frost.
</p>
<p>
And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,<br>
    Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!”<br>
    But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
</p>
<p>
He said: “By other ways, by other ports<br>
    Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;<br>
    A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.”
</p>
<p>
And unto him the Guide: “Vex thee not, Charon;<br>
    It is so willed there where is power to do<br>
    That which is willed; and farther question not.”
</p>
<p>
Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks<br>
    Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,<br>
    Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.
</p>
<p>
But all those souls who weary were and naked<br>
    Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,<br>
    As soon as they had heard those cruel words.
</p>
<p>
God they blasphemed and their progenitors,<br>
    The human race, the place, the time, the seed<br>
    Of their engendering and of their birth!
</p>
<p>
Thereafter all together they drew back,<br>
    Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,<br>
    Which waiteth every man who fears not God.
</p>
<p>
Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<br>
    Beckoning to them, collects them all together,<br>
    Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.
</p>
<p>
As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,<br>
    First one and then another, till the branch<br>
    Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;
</p>
<p>
In similar wise the evil seed of Adam<br>
    Throw themselves from that margin one by one,<br>
    At signals, as a bird unto its lure.
</p>
<p>
So they depart across the dusky wave,<br>
    And ere upon the other side they land,<br>
    Again on this side a new troop assembles.
</p>
<p>
“My son,” the courteous Master said to me,<br>
    “All those who perish in the wrath of God<br>
    Here meet together out of every land;
</p>
<p>
And ready are they to pass o’er the river,<br>
    Because celestial Justice spurs them on,<br>
    So that their fear is turned into desire.
</p>
<p>
This way there never passes a good soul;<br>
    And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,<br>
    Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.”
</p>
<p>
This being finished, all the dusk champaign<br>
    Trembled so violently, that of that terror<br>
    The recollection bathes me still with sweat.
</p>
<p>
The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,<br>
    And fulminated a vermilion light,<br>
    Which overmastered in me every sense,
</p>
<p>
And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.IV">
<p>
Broke the deep lethargy within my head<br>
    A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,<br>
    Like to a person who by force is wakened;
</p>
<p>
And round about I moved my rested eyes,<br>
    Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,<br>
    To recognise the place wherein I was.
</p>
<p>
True is it, that upon the verge I found me<br>
    Of the abysmal valley dolorous,<br>
    That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.
</p>
<p>
Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,<br>
    So that by fixing on its depths my sight<br>
    Nothing whatever I discerned therein.

“Let us descend now into the blind world,”<br>
    Began the Poet, pallid utterly;<br>
    “I will be first, and thou shalt second be.”
</p>
<p>
And I, who of his colour was aware,<br>
    Said: “How shall I come, if thou art afraid,<br>
    Who’rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “The anguish of the people<br>
    Who are below here in my face depicts<br>
    That pity which for terror thou hast taken.
</p>
<p>
Let us go on, for the long way impels us.”<br>
    Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter<br>
    The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.
</p>
<p>
There, as it seemed to me from listening,<br>
    Were lamentations none, but only sighs,<br>
    That tremble made the everlasting air.
</p>
<p>
And this arose from sorrow without torment,<br>
    Which the crowds had, that many were and great,<br>
    Of infants and of women and of men.
</p>
<p>
To me the Master good: “Thou dost not ask<br>
    What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?<br>
    Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,
</p>
<p>
That they sinned not; and if they merit had,<br>
    ’Tis not enough, because they had not baptism<br>
    Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;
</p>
<p>
And if they were before Christianity,<br>
    In the right manner they adored not God;<br>
    And among such as these am I myself.
</p>
<p>
For such defects, and not for other guilt,<br>
    Lost are we and are only so far punished,<br>
    That without hope we live on in desire.”
</p>
<p>
Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,<br>
    Because some people of much worthiness<br>
    I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,”<br>
    Began I, with desire of being certain<br>
    Of that Faith which o’ercometh every error,
</p>
<p>
“Came any one by his own merit hence,<br>
    Or by another’s, who was blessed thereafter?”<br>
    And he, who understood my covert speech,
</p>
<p>
Replied: “I was a novice in this state,<br>
    When I saw hither come a Mighty One,<br>
    With sign of victory incoronate.
</p>
<p>
Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,<br>
    And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,<br>
    Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient
</p>
<p>
Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,<br>
    Israel with his father and his children,<br>
    And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,
</p>
<p>
And others many, and he made them blessed;<br>
    And thou must know, that earlier than these<br>
    Never were any human spirits saved.”
</p>
<p>
We ceased not to advance because he spake,<br>
    But still were passing onward through the forest,<br>
    The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.
</p>
<p>
Not very far as yet our way had gone<br>
    This side the summit, when I saw a fire<br>
    That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.
</p>
<p>
We were a little distant from it still,<br>
    But not so far that I in part discerned not<br>
    That honourable people held that place.
</p>
<p>
“O thou who honourest every art and science,<br>
    Who may these be, which such great honour have,<br>
    That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “The honourable name,<br>
    That sounds of them above there in thy life,<br>
    Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.”
</p>
<p>
In the mean time a voice was heard by me:<br>
    “All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;<br>
    His shade returns again, that was departed.”
</p>
<p>
After the voice had ceased and quiet was,<br>
    Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;<br>
    Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.
</p>
<p>
To say to me began my gracious Master:<br>
    “Him with that falchion in his hand behold,<br>
    Who comes before the three, even as their lord.
</p>
<p>
That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;<br>
    He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;<br>
    The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.
</p>
<p>
Because to each of these with me applies<br>
    The name that solitary voice proclaimed,<br>
    They do me honour, and in that do well.”
</p>
<p>
Thus I beheld assemble the fair school<br>
    Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,<br>
    Who o’er the others like an eagle soars.
</p>
<p>
When they together had discoursed somewhat,<br>
    They turned to me with signs of salutation,<br>
    And on beholding this, my Master smiled;
</p>
<p>
And more of honour still, much more, they did me,<br>
    In that they made me one of their own band;<br>
    So that the sixth was I, ’mid so much wit.
</p>
<p>
Thus we went on as far as to the light,<br>
    Things saying ’tis becoming to keep silent,<br>
    As was the saying of them where I was.
</p>
<p>
We came unto a noble castle’s foot,<br>
    Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,<br>
    Defended round by a fair rivulet;
</p>
<p>
This we passed over even as firm ground;<br>
    Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;<br>
    We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.
</p>
<p>
People were there with solemn eyes and slow,<br>
    Of great authority in their countenance;<br>
    They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.
</p>
<p>
Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side<br>
    Into an opening luminous and lofty,<br>
    So that they all of them were visible.
</p>
<p>
There opposite, upon the green enamel,<br>
    Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,<br>
    Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.
</p>
<p>
I saw Electra with companions many,<br>
    ’Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,<br>
    Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;
</p>
<p>
I saw Camilla and Penthesilea<br>
    On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,<br>
    Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;
</p>
<p>
I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,<br>
    Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<br>
    And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.
</p>
<p>
When I had lifted up my brows a little,<br>
    The Master I beheld of those who know,<br>
    Sit with his philosophic family.
</p>
<p>
All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.<br>
    There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,<br>
    Who nearer him before the others stand;
</p>
<p>
Democritus, who puts the world on chance,<br>
    Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,<br>
    Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;
</p>
<p>
Of qualities I saw the good collector,<br>
    Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,<br>
    Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,
</p>
<p>
Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,<br>
    Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,<br>
    Averroes, who the great Comment made.
</p>
<p>
I cannot all of them pourtray in full,<br>
    Because so drives me onward the long theme,<br>
    That many times the word comes short of fact.
</p>
<p>
The sixfold company in two divides;<br>
    Another way my sapient Guide conducts me<br>
    Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;
</p>
<p>
And to a place I come where nothing shines.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.V">
<p>
Thus I descended out of the first circle<br>
    Down to the second, that less space begirds,<br>
    And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.
</p>
<p>
There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;<br>
    Examines the transgressions at the entrance;<br>
    Judges, and sends according as he girds him.
</p>
<p>
I say, that when the spirit evil-born<br>
    Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;<br>
    And this discriminator of transgressions
</p>
<p>
Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;<br>
    Girds himself with his tail as many times<br>
    As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.
</p>
<p>
Always before him many of them stand;<br>
    They go by turns each one unto the judgment;<br>
    They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.
</p>
<p>
“O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry<br>
    Comest,” said Minos to me, when he saw me,<br>
    Leaving the practice of so great an office,
</p>
<p>
“Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;<br>
    Let not the portal’s amplitude deceive thee.”<br>
    And unto him my Guide: “Why criest thou too?
</p>
<p>
Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;<br>
    It is so willed there where is power to do<br>
    That which is willed; and ask no further question.”
</p>
<p>
And now begin the dolesome notes to grow<br>
    Audible unto me; now am I come<br>
    There where much lamentation strikes upon me.
</p>
<p>
I came into a place mute of all light,<br>
    Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,<br>
    If by opposing winds ’t is combated.
</p>
<p>
The infernal hurricane that never rests<br>
    Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;<br>
    Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.
</p>
<p>
When they arrive before the precipice,<br>
    There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,<br>
    There they blaspheme the puissance divine.
</p>
<p>
I understood that unto such a torment<br>
    The carnal malefactors were condemned,<br>
    Who reason subjugate to appetite.
</p>
<p>
And as the wings of starlings bear them on<br>
    In the cold season in large band and full,<br>
    So doth that blast the spirits maledict;
</p>
<p>
It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;<br>
    No hope doth comfort them for evermore,<br>
    Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.
</p>
<p>
And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,<br>
    Making in air a long line of themselves,<br>
    So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,
</p>
<p>
Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.<br>
    Whereupon said I: “Master, who are those<br>
    People, whom the black air so castigates?”
</p>
<p>
“The first of those, of whom intelligence<br>
    Thou fain wouldst have,” then said he unto me,<br>
    “The empress was of many languages.
</p>
<p>
To sensual vices she was so abandoned,<br>
    That lustful she made licit in her law,<br>
    To remove the blame to which she had been led.
</p>
<p>
She is Semiramis, of whom we read<br>
    That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;<br>
    She held the land which now the Sultan rules.
</p>
<p>
The next is she who killed herself for love,<br>
    And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;<br>
    Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.”
</p>
<p>
Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless<br>
    Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,<br>
    Who at the last hour combated with Love.
</p>
<p>
Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand<br>
    Shades did he name and point out with his finger,<br>
    Whom Love had separated from our life.
</p>
<p>
After that I had listened to my Teacher,<br>
    Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,<br>
    Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.
</p>
<p>
And I began: “O Poet, willingly<br>
    Speak would I to those two, who go together,<br>
    And seem upon the wind to be so light.”
</p>
<p>
And, he to me: “Thou’lt mark, when they shall be<br>
    Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them<br>
    By love which leadeth them, and they will come.”
</p>
<p>
Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,<br>
    My voice uplift I: “O ye weary souls!<br>
    Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.”
</p>
<p>
As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,<br>
    With open and steady wings to the sweet nest<br>
    Fly through the air by their volition borne,
</p>
<p>
So came they from the band where Dido is,<br>
    Approaching us athwart the air malign,<br>
    So strong was the affectionate appeal.
</p>
<p>
“O living creature gracious and benignant,<br>
    Who visiting goest through the purple air<br>
    Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,
</p>
<p>
If were the King of the Universe our friend,<br>
    We would pray unto him to give thee peace,<br>
    Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.
</p>
<p>
Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,<br>
    That will we hear, and we will speak to you,<br>
    While silent is the wind, as it is now.
</p>
<p>
Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,<br>
    Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends<br>
    To rest in peace with all his retinue.
</p>
<p>
Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,<br>
    Seized this man for the person beautiful<br>
    That was ta’en from me, and still the mode offends me.
</p>
<p>
Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,<br>
    Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,<br>
    That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;
</p>
<p>
Love has conducted us unto one death;<br>
    Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!”<br>
    These words were borne along from them to us.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,<br>
    I bowed my face, and so long held it down<br>
    Until the Poet said to me: “What thinkest?”
</p>
<p>
When I made answer, I began: “Alas!<br>
    How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,<br>
    Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!”
</p>
<p>
Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,<br>
    And I began: “Thine agonies, Francesca,<br>
    Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.
</p>
<p>
But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,<br>
    By what and in what manner Love conceded,<br>
    That you should know your dubious desires?”
</p>
<p>
And she to me: “There is no greater sorrow<br>
    Than to be mindful of the happy time<br>
    In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.
</p>
<p>
But, if to recognise the earliest root<br>
    Of love in us thou hast so great desire,<br>
    I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.
</p>
<p>
One day we reading were for our delight<br>
    Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.<br>
    Alone we were and without any fear.
</p>
<p>
Full many a time our eyes together drew<br>
    That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;<br>
    But one point only was it that o’ercame us.
</p>
<p>
When as we read of the much-longed-for smile<br>
    Being by such a noble lover kissed,<br>
    This one, who ne’er from me shall be divided,
</p>
<p>
Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.<br>
    Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.<br>
    That day no farther did we read therein.”
</p>
<p>
And all the while one spirit uttered this,<br>
    The other one did weep so, that, for pity,<br>
    I swooned away as if I had been dying,
</p>
<p>
And fell, even as a dead body falls.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.VI">
<p>
At the return of consciousness, that closed<br>
    Before the pity of those two relations,<br>
    Which utterly with sadness had confused me,
</p>
<p>
New torments I behold, and new tormented<br>
    Around me, whichsoever way I move,<br>
    And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.
</p>
<p>
In the third circle am I of the rain<br>
    Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;<br>
    Its law and quality are never new.
</p>
<p>
Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,<br>
    Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;<br>
    Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.
</p>
<p>
Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,<br>
    With his three gullets like a dog is barking<br>
    Over the people that are there submerged.
</p>
<p>
Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,<br>
    And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;<br>
    He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.
</p>
<p>
Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;<br>
    One side they make a shelter for the other;<br>
    Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.
</p>
<p>
When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!<br>
     His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;<br>
     Not a limb had he that was motionless.
</p>
<p>
And my Conductor, with his spans extended,<br>
    Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,<br>
    He threw it into those rapacious gullets.
</p>
<p>
Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,<br>
    And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,<br>
    For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,
</p>
<p>
The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed<br>
    Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders<br>
    Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.
</p>
<p>
We passed across the shadows, which subdues<br>
    The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet<br>
    Upon their vanity that person seems.
</p>
<p>
They all were lying prone upon the earth,<br>
    Excepting one, who sat upright as soon<br>
    As he beheld us passing on before him.
</p>
<p>
“O thou that art conducted through this Hell,”<br>
    He said to me, “recall me, if thou canst;<br>
    Thyself wast made before I was unmade.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “The anguish which thou hast<br>
    Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,<br>
    So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.
</p>
<p>
But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful<br>
    A place art put, and in such punishment,<br>
    If some are greater, none is so displeasing.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Thy city, which is full<br>
    Of envy so that now the sack runs over,<br>
    Held me within it in the life serene.
</p>
<p>
You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;<br>
    For the pernicious sin of gluttony<br>
    I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.
</p>
<p>
And I, sad soul, am not the only one,<br>
    For all these suffer the like penalty<br>
    For the like sin;” and word no more spake he.
</p>
<p>
I answered him: “Ciacco, thy wretchedness<br>
    Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;<br>
    But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
</p>
<p>
The citizens of the divided city;<br>
    If any there be just; and the occasion<br>
    Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “They, after long contention,<br>
    Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party<br>
    Will drive the other out with much offence.
</p>
<p>
Then afterwards behoves it this one fall<br>
    Within three suns, and rise again the other<br>
    By force of him who now is on the coast.
</p>
<p>
High will it hold its forehead a long while,<br>
    Keeping the other under heavy burdens,<br>
    Howe’er it weeps thereat and is indignant.
</p>
<p>
The just are two, and are not understood there;<br>
    Envy and Arrogance and Avarice<br>
    Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.”
</p>
<p>
Here ended he his tearful utterance;<br>
    And I to him: “I wish thee still to teach me,<br>
    And make a gift to me of further speech.
</p>
<p>
Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,<br>
    Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,<br>
    And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,
</p>
<p>
Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;<br>
    For great desire constraineth me to learn<br>
    If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.”
</p>
<p>
And he: “They are among the blacker souls;<br>
    A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;<br>
    If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.
</p>
<p>
But when thou art again in the sweet world,<br>
    I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;<br>
    No more I tell thee and no more I answer.”
</p>
<p>
Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,<br>
    Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;<br>
    He fell therewith prone like the other blind.
</p>
<p>
And the Guide said to me: “He wakes no more<br>
    This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;<br>
    When shall approach the hostile Potentate,
</p>
<p>
Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,<br>
    Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,<br>
    Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.”
</p>
<p>
So we passed onward o’er the filthy mixture<br>
    Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,<br>
    Touching a little on the future life.
</p>
<p>
Wherefore I said: “Master, these torments here,<br>
    Will they increase after the mighty sentence,<br>
    Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Return unto thy science,<br>
    Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,<br>
    The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.
</p>
<p>
Albeit that this people maledict<br>
    To true perfection never can attain,<br>
    Hereafter more than now they look to be.”
</p>
<p>
Round in a circle by that road we went,<br>
    Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;<br>
    We came unto the point where the descent is;
</p>
<p>
There we found Plutus the great enemy.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.VII">
<p>
“Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!”<br>
    Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;<br>
    And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,
</p>
<p>
Said, to encourage me: “Let not thy fear<br>
    Harm thee; for any power that he may have<br>
    Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.”
</p>
<p>
Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,<br>
    And said: “Be silent, thou accursed wolf;<br>
    Consume within thyself with thine own rage.
</p>
<p>
Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;<br>
    Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought<br>
    Vengeance upon the proud adultery.”
</p>
<p>
Even as the sails inflated by the wind<br>
    Involved together fall when snaps the mast,<br>
    So fell the cruel monster to the earth.
</p>
<p>
Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,<br>
    Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore<br>
    Which all the woe of the universe insacks.
</p>
<p>
Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many<br>
    New toils and sufferings as I beheld?<br>
    And why doth our transgression waste us so?
</p>
<p>
As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,<br>
    That breaks itself on that which it encounters,<br>
    So here the folk must dance their roundelay.
</p>
<p>
Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,<br>
    On one side and the other, with great howls,<br>
    Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.
</p>
<p>
They clashed together, and then at that point<br>
    Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,<br>
    Crying, “Why keepest?” and, “Why squanderest thou?”
</p>
<p>
Thus they returned along the lurid circle<br>
    On either hand unto the opposite point,<br>
    Shouting their shameful metre evermore.
</p>
<p>
Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about<br>
    Through his half-circle to another joust;<br>
    And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,
</p>
<p>
Exclaimed: “My Master, now declare to me<br>
    What people these are, and if all were clerks,<br>
    These shaven crowns upon the left of us.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “All of them were asquint<br>
    In intellect in the first life, so much<br>
    That there with measure they no spending made.
</p>
<p>
Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,<br>
    Whene’er they reach the two points of the circle,<br>
    Where sunders them the opposite defect.
</p>
<p>
Clerks those were who no hairy covering<br>
    Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,<br>
    In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “My Master, among such as these<br>
    I ought forsooth to recognise some few,<br>
    Who were infected with these maladies.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Vain thought thou entertainest;<br>
    The undiscerning life which made them sordid<br>
    Now makes them unto all discernment dim.
</p>
<p>
Forever shall they come to these two buttings;<br>
    These from the sepulchre shall rise again<br>
    With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.
</p>
<p>
Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world<br>
    Have ta’en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;<br>
    Whate’er it be, no words adorn I for it.
</p>
<p>
Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce<br>
    Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,<br>
    For which the human race each other buffet;
</p>
<p>
For all the gold that is beneath the moon,<br>
    Or ever has been, of these weary souls<br>
    Could never make a single one repose.”
</p>
<p>
“Master,” I said to him, “now tell me also<br>
    What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,<br>
    That has the world’s goods so within its clutches?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “O creatures imbecile,<br>
    What ignorance is this which doth beset you?<br>
    Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.
</p>
<p>
He whose omniscience everything transcends<br>
    The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,<br>
    That every part to every part may shine,
</p>
<p>
Distributing the light in equal measure;<br>
    He in like manner to the mundane splendours<br>
    Ordained a general ministress and guide,
</p>
<p>
That she might change at times the empty treasures<br>
    From race to race, from one blood to another,<br>
    Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Therefore one people triumphs, and another<br>
    Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,<br>
    Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.
</p>
<p>
Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;<br>
    She makes provision, judges, and pursues<br>
    Her governance, as theirs the other gods.
</p>
<p>
Her permutations have not any truce;<br>
    Necessity makes her precipitate,<br>
    So often cometh who his turn obtains.
</p>
<p>
And this is she who is so crucified<br>
    Even by those who ought to give her praise,<br>
    Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.
</p>
<p>
But she is blissful, and she hears it not;<br>
    Among the other primal creatures gladsome<br>
    She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.
</p>
<p>
Let us descend now unto greater woe;<br>
    Already sinks each star that was ascending<br>
    When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.”
</p>
<p>
We crossed the circle to the other bank,<br>
    Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself<br>
    Along a gully that runs out of it.
</p>
<p>
The water was more sombre far than perse;<br>
    And we, in company with the dusky waves,<br>
    Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.
</p>
<p>
A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,<br>
    This tristful brooklet, when it has descended<br>
    Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.
</p>
<p>
And I, who stood intent upon beholding,<br>
    Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,<br>
    All of them naked and with angry look.
</p>
<p>
They smote each other not alone with hands,<br>
    But with the head and with the breast and feet,<br>
    Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.
</p>
<p>
Said the good Master: “Son, thou now beholdest<br>
    The souls of those whom anger overcame;<br>
    And likewise I would have thee know for certain
</p>
<p>
Beneath the water people are who sigh<br>
    And make this water bubble at the surface,<br>
    As the eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turns.
</p>
<p>
Fixed in the mire they say, ‘We sullen were<br>
    In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,<br>
    Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;
</p>
<p>
Now we are sullen in this sable mire.’<br>
    This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,<br>
    For with unbroken words they cannot say it.”
</p>
<p>
Thus we went circling round the filthy fen<br>
    A great arc ’twixt the dry bank and the swamp,<br>
    With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;
</p>
<p>
Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.VIII">
<p>
I say, continuing, that long before<br>
    We to the foot of that high tower had come,<br>
    Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,
</p>
<p>
By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,<br>
    And from afar another answer them,<br>
    So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.
</p>
<p>
And, to the sea of all discernment turned,<br>
    I said: “What sayeth this, and what respondeth<br>
    That other fire? and who are they that made it?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Across the turbid waves<br>
    What is expected thou canst now discern,<br>
    If reek of the morass conceal it not.”
</p>
<p>
Cord never shot an arrow from itself<br>
    That sped away athwart the air so swift,<br>
    As I beheld a very little boat
</p>
<p>
Come o’er the water tow’rds us at that moment,<br>
    Under the guidance of a single pilot,<br>
    Who shouted, “Now art thou arrived, fell soul?”
</p>
<p>
“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain<br>
    For this once,” said my Lord; “thou shalt not have us<br>
    Longer than in the passing of the slough.”
</p>
<p>
As he who listens to some great deceit<br>
    That has been done to him, and then resents it,<br>
    Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.
</p>
<p>
My Guide descended down into the boat,<br>
    And then he made me enter after him,<br>
    And only when I entered seemed it laden.
</p>
<p>
Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,<br>
    The antique prow goes on its way, dividing<br>
    More of the water than ’tis wont with others.
</p>
<p>
While we were running through the dead canal,<br>
    Uprose in front of me one full of mire,<br>
    And said, “Who ’rt thou that comest ere the hour?”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “Although I come, I stay not;<br>
    But who art thou that hast become so squalid?”<br>
    “Thou seest that I am one who weeps,” he answered.
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “With weeping and with wailing,<br>
    Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;<br>
    For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.”
</p>
<p>
Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;<br>
    Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,<br>
    Saying, “Away there with the other dogs!”
</p>
<p>
Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;<br>
    He kissed my face, and said: “Disdainful soul,<br>
    Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.
</p>
<p>
That was an arrogant person in the world;<br>
    Goodness is none, that decks his memory;<br>
    So likewise here his shade is furious.
</p>
<p>
How many are esteemed great kings up there,<br>
    Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,<br>
    Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!”
</p>
<p>
And I: “My Master, much should I be pleased,<br>
    If I could see him soused into this broth,<br>
    Before we issue forth out of the lake.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Ere unto thee the shore<br>
    Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;<br>
    Such a desire ’tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.”
</p>
<p>
A little after that, I saw such havoc<br>
    Made of him by the people of the mire,<br>
    That still I praise and thank my God for it.
</p>
<p>
They all were shouting, “At Philippo Argenti!”<br>
    And that exasperate spirit Florentine<br>
    Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.
</p>
<p>
We left him there, and more of him I tell not;<br>
    But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,<br>
    Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.
</p>
<p>
And the good Master said: “Even now, my Son,<br>
    The city draweth near whose name is Dis,<br>
    With the grave citizens, with the great throng.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “Its mosques already, Master, clearly<br>
    Within there in the valley I discern<br>
    Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
</p>
<p>
They were.”  And he to me: “The fire eternal<br>
    That kindles them within makes them look red,<br>
    As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.”
</p>
<p>
Then we arrived within the moats profound,<br>
    That circumvallate that disconsolate city;<br>
    The walls appeared to me to be of iron.
</p>
<p>
Not without making first a circuit wide,<br>
    We came unto a place where loud the pilot<br>
    Cried out to us, “Debark, here is the entrance.”
</p>
<p>
More than a thousand at the gates I saw<br>
    Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily<br>
    Were saying, “Who is this that without death
</p>
<p>
Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?”<br>
    And my sagacious Master made a sign<br>
    Of wishing secretly to speak with them.
</p>
<p>
A little then they quelled their great disdain,<br>
    And said: “Come thou alone, and he begone<br>
    Who has so boldly entered these dominions.
</p>
<p>
Let him return alone by his mad road;<br>
    Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,<br>
    Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.”
</p>
<p>
Think, Reader, if I was discomforted<br>
    At utterance of the accursed words;<br>
    For never to return here I believed.
</p>
<p>
“O my dear Guide, who more than seven times<br>
    Hast rendered me security, and drawn me<br>
    From imminent peril that before me stood,
</p>
<p>
Do not desert me,” said I, “thus undone;<br>
    And if the going farther be denied us,<br>
    Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.”
</p>
<p>
And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,<br>
    Said unto me: “Fear not; because our passage<br>
    None can take from us, it by Such is given.
</p>
<p>
But here await me, and thy weary spirit<br>
    Comfort and nourish with a better hope;<br>
    For in this nether world I will not leave thee.”
</p>
<p>
So onward goes and there abandons me<br>
    My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,<br>
    For No and Yes within my head contend.
</p>
<p>
I could not hear what he proposed to them;<br>
    But with them there he did not linger long,<br>
    Ere each within in rivalry ran back.
</p>
<p>
They closed the portals, those our adversaries,<br>
    On my Lord’s breast, who had remained without<br>
    And turned to me with footsteps far between.
</p>
<p>
His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he<br>
    Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,<br>
    “Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?”
</p>
<p>
And unto me: “Thou, because I am angry,<br>
    Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,<br>
    Whatever for defence within be planned.
</p>
<p>
This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;<br>
    For once they used it at less secret gate,<br>
    Which finds itself without a fastening still.
</p>
<p>
O’er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;<br>
    And now this side of it descends the steep,<br>
    Passing across the circles without escort,
</p>
<p>
One by whose means the city shall be opened.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.IX">
<p>
That hue which cowardice brought out on me,<br>
    Beholding my Conductor backward turn,<br>
    Sooner repressed within him his new colour.
</p>
<p>
He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,<br>
    Because the eye could not conduct him far<br>
    Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.
</p>
<p>
“Still it behoveth us to win the fight,”<br>
    Began he; “Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .<br>
    O how I long that some one here arrive!”
</p>
<p>
Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning<br>
    He covered up with what came afterward,<br>
    That they were words quite different from the first;
</p>
<p>
But none the less his saying gave me fear,<br>
    Because I carried out the broken phrase,<br>
    Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.
</p>
<p>
“Into this bottom of the doleful conch<br>
    Doth any e’er descend from the first grade,<br>
    Which for its pain has only hope cut off?”
</p>
<p>
This question put I; and he answered me:<br>
    “Seldom it comes to pass that one of us<br>
    Maketh the journey upon which I go.
</p>
<p>
True is it, once before I here below<br>
    Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,<br>
    Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.
</p>
<p>
Naked of me short while the flesh had been,<br>
    Before within that wall she made me enter,<br>
    To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;
</p>
<p>
That is the lowest region and the darkest,<br>
    And farthest from the heaven which circles all.<br>
    Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.
</p>
<p>
This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,<br>
    Encompasses about the city dolent,<br>
    Where now we cannot enter without anger.”
</p>
<p>
And more he said, but not in mind I have it;<br>
    Because mine eye had altogether drawn me<br>
    Tow’rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,
</p>
<p>
Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen<br>
    The three infernal Furies stained with blood,<br>
    Who had the limbs of women and their mien,
</p>
<p>
And with the greenest hydras were begirt;<br>
    Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,<br>
    Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.
</p>
<p>
And he who well the handmaids of the Queen<br>
    Of everlasting lamentation knew,<br>
    Said unto me: “Behold the fierce Erinnys.
</p>
<p>
This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;<br>
    She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;<br>
    Tisiphone is between;” and then was silent.
</p>
<p>
Each one her breast was rending with her nails;<br>
    They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,<br>
    That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.
</p>
<p>
“Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!”<br>
    All shouted looking down; “in evil hour<br>
    Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!”
</p>
<p>
“Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,<br>
    For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,<br>
    No more returning upward would there be.”
</p>
<p>
Thus said the Master; and he turned me round<br>
    Himself, and trusted not unto my hands<br>
    So far as not to blind me with his own.
</p>
<p>
O ye who have undistempered intellects,<br>
    Observe the doctrine that conceals itself<br>
    Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!
</p>
<p>
And now there came across the turbid waves<br>
    The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,<br>
    Because of which both of the margins trembled;
</p>
<p>
Not otherwise it was than of a wind<br>
    Impetuous on account of adverse heats,<br>
    That smites the forest, and, without restraint,
</p>
<p>
The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;<br>
    Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,<br>
    And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.
</p>
<p>
Mine eyes he loosed, and said: “Direct the nerve<br>
    Of vision now along that ancient foam,<br>
    There yonder where that smoke is most intense.”
</p>
<p>
Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent<br>
    Across the water scatter all abroad,<br>
    Until each one is huddled in the earth.
</p>
<p>
More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,<br>
    Thus fleeing from before one who on foot<br>
    Was passing o’er the Styx with soles unwet.
</p>
<p>
From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,<br>
    Waving his left hand oft in front of him,<br>
    And only with that anguish seemed he weary.
</p>
<p>
Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,<br>
    And to the Master turned; and he made sign<br>
    That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.
</p>
<p>
Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!<br>
    He reached the gate, and with a little rod<br>
    He opened it, for there was no resistance.
</p>
<p>
“O banished out of Heaven, people despised!”<br>
    Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;<br>
    “Whence is this arrogance within you couched?
</p>
<p>
Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,<br>
    From which the end can never be cut off,<br>
    And which has many times increased your pain?
</p>
<p>
What helpeth it to butt against the fates?<br>
    Your Cerberus, if you remember well,<br>
    For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.”
</p>
<p>
Then he returned along the miry road,<br>
    And spake no word to us, but had the look<br>
    Of one whom other care constrains and goads
</p>
<p>
Than that of him who in his presence is;<br>
    And we our feet directed tow’rds the city,<br>
    After those holy words all confident.
</p>
<p>
Within we entered without any contest;<br>
    And I, who inclination had to see<br>
    What the condition such a fortress holds,
</p>
<p>
Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,<br>
    And see on every hand an ample plain,<br>
    Full of distress and torment terrible.
</p>
<p>
Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,<br>
    Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,<br>
    That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,
</p>
<p>
The sepulchres make all the place uneven;<br>
    So likewise did they there on every side,<br>
    Saving that there the manner was more bitter;
</p>
<p>
For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,<br>
    By which they so intensely heated were,<br>
    That iron more so asks not any art.
</p>
<p>
All of their coverings uplifted were,<br>
    And from them issued forth such dire laments,<br>
    Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.
</p>
<p>
And I: “My Master, what are all those people<br>
    Who, having sepulture within those tombs,<br>
    Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Here are the Heresiarchs,<br>
    With their disciples of all sects, and much<br>
    More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.
</p>
<p>
Here like together with its like is buried;<br>
    And more and less the monuments are heated.”<br>
    And when he to the right had turned, we passed
</p>
<p>
Between the torments and high parapets.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.X">
<p>
Now onward goes, along a narrow path<br>
    Between the torments and the city wall,<br>
    My Master, and I follow at his back.
</p>
<p>
“O power supreme, that through these impious circles<br>
    Turnest me,” I began, “as pleases thee,<br>
    Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;
</p>
<p>
The people who are lying in these tombs,<br>
    Might they be seen? already are uplifted<br>
    The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “They all will be closed up<br>
    When from Jehoshaphat they shall return<br>
    Here with the bodies they have left above.
</p>
<p>
Their cemetery have upon this side<br>
    With Epicurus all his followers,<br>
    Who with the body mortal make the soul;
</p>
<p>
But in the question thou dost put to me,<br>
    Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,<br>
    And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “Good Leader, I but keep concealed<br>
    From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,<br>
    Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.”
</p>
<p>
“O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire<br>
    Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,<br>
    Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.
</p>
<p>
Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest<br>
    A native of that noble fatherland,<br>
    To which perhaps I too molestful was.”
</p>
<p>
Upon a sudden issued forth this sound<br>
    From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,<br>
    Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.
</p>
<p>
And unto me he said: “Turn thee; what dost thou?<br>
    Behold there Farinata who has risen;<br>
    From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.”
</p>
<p>
I had already fixed mine eyes on his,<br>
    And he uprose erect with breast and front<br>
    E’en as if Hell he had in great despite.
</p>
<p>
And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader<br>
    Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,<br>
    Exclaiming, “Let thy words explicit be.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb<br>
    Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,<br>
    Then asked of me, “Who were thine ancestors?”
</p>
<p>
I, who desirous of obeying was,<br>
    Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;<br>
    Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.
</p>
<p>
Then said he: “Fiercely adverse have they been<br>
    To me, and to my fathers, and my party;<br>
    So that two several times I scattered them.”
</p>
<p>
“If they were banished, they returned on all sides,”<br>
    I answered him, “the first time and the second;<br>
    But yours have not acquired that art aright.”
</p>
<p>
Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered<br>
    Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;<br>
    I think that he had risen on his knees.
</p>
<p>
Round me he gazed, as if solicitude<br>
    He had to see if some one else were with me,<br>
    But after his suspicion was all spent,
</p>
<p>
Weeping, he said to me: “If through this blind<br>
    Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,<br>
    Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “I come not of myself;<br>
    He who is waiting yonder leads me here,<br>
    Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.”
</p>
<p>
His language and the mode of punishment<br>
    Already unto me had read his name;<br>
    On that account my answer was so full.
</p>
<p>
Up starting suddenly, he cried out: “How<br>
    Saidst thou,—he had?  Is he not still alive?<br>
    Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”
</p>
<p>
When he became aware of some delay,<br>
    Which I before my answer made, supine<br>
    He fell again, and forth appeared no more.
</p>
<p>
But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire<br>
    I had remained, did not his aspect change,<br>
    Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.
</p>
<p>
“And if,” continuing his first discourse,<br>
    “They have that art,” he said, “not learned aright,<br>
    That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.
</p>
<p>
But fifty times shall not rekindled be<br>
    The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,<br>
    Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;
</p>
<p>
And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,<br>
    Say why that people is so pitiless<br>
    Against my race in each one of its laws?”
</p>
<p>
Whence I to him: “The slaughter and great carnage<br>
    Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause<br>
    Such orisons in our temple to be made.”
</p>
<p>
After his head he with a sigh had shaken,<br>
    “There I was not alone,” he said, “nor surely<br>
    Without a cause had with the others moved.
</p>
<p>
But there I was alone, where every one<br>
    Consented to the laying waste of Florence,<br>
    He who defended her with open face.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,”<br>
    I him entreated, “solve for me that knot,<br>
    Which has entangled my conceptions here.
</p>
<p>
It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,<br>
    Beforehand whatsoe’er time brings with it,<br>
    And in the present have another mode.”
</p>
<p>
“We see, like those who have imperfect sight,<br>
    The things,” he said, “that distant are from us;<br>
    So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.
</p>
<p>
When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain<br>
    Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,<br>
    Not anything know we of your human state.
</p>
<p>
Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead<br>
    Will be our knowledge from the moment when<br>
    The portal of the future shall be closed.”
</p>
<p>
Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,<br>
    Said: “Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,<br>
    That still his son is with the living joined.
</p>
<p>
And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,<br>
    Tell him I did it because I was thinking<br>
    Already of the error you have solved me.”
</p>
<p>
And now my Master was recalling me,<br>
    Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit<br>
    That he would tell me who was with him there.
</p>
<p>
He said: “With more than a thousand here I lie;<br>
    Within here is the second Frederick,<br>
    And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.”
</p>
<p>
Thereon he hid himself; and I towards<br>
    The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting<br>
    Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.
</p>
<p>
He moved along; and afterward thus going,<br>
    He said to me, “Why art thou so bewildered?”<br>
    And I in his inquiry satisfied him.
</p>
<p>
“Let memory preserve what thou hast heard<br>
    Against thyself,” that Sage commanded me,<br>
    “And now attend here;” and he raised his finger.
</p>
<p>
“When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet<br>
    Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,<br>
    From her thou’lt know the journey of thy life.”
</p>
<p>
Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;<br>
    We left the wall, and went towards the middle,<br>
    Along a path that strikes into a valley,
</p>
<p>
Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XI">
<p>
Upon the margin of a lofty bank<br>
    Which great rocks broken in a circle made,<br>
    We came upon a still more cruel throng;
</p>
<p>
And there, by reason of the horrible<br>
    Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,<br>
    We drew ourselves aside behind the cover
</p>
<p>
Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,<br>
    Which said: “Pope Anastasius I hold,<br>
    Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.”
</p>
<p>
“Slow it behoveth our descent to be,<br>
    So that the sense be first a little used<br>
    To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.”
</p>
<p>
The Master thus; and unto him I said,<br>
    “Some compensation find, that the time pass not<br>
    Idly;” and he: “Thou seest I think of that.
</p>
<p>
My son, upon the inside of these rocks,”<br>
    Began he then to say, “are three small circles,<br>
    From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.
</p>
<p>
They all are full of spirits maledict;<br>
    But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,<br>
    Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.
</p>
<p>
Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,<br>
    Injury is the end; and all such end<br>
    Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.
</p>
<p>
But because fraud is man’s peculiar vice,<br>
    More it displeases God; and so stand lowest<br>
    The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.
</p>
<p>
All the first circle of the Violent is;<br>
    But since force may be used against three persons,<br>
    In three rounds ’tis divided and constructed.
</p>
<p>
To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we<br>
    Use force; I say on them and on their things,<br>
    As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.
</p>
<p>
A death by violence, and painful wounds,<br>
    Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance<br>
    Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;
</p>
<p>
Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,<br>
    Marauders, and freebooters, the first round<br>
    Tormenteth all in companies diverse.
</p>
<p>
Man may lay violent hands upon himself<br>
    And his own goods; and therefore in the second<br>
    Round must perforce without avail repent
</p>
<p>
Whoever of your world deprives himself,<br>
    Who games, and dissipates his property,<br>
    And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.
</p>
<p>
Violence can be done the Deity,<br>
    In heart denying and blaspheming Him,<br>
    And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.
</p>
<p>
And for this reason doth the smallest round<br>
    Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,<br>
    And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.
</p>
<p>
Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,<br>
    A man may practise upon him who trusts,<br>
    And him who doth no confidence imburse.
</p>
<p>
This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers<br>
    Only the bond of love which Nature makes;<br>
    Wherefore within the second circle nestle
</p>
<p>
Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,<br>
    Falsification, theft, and simony,<br>
    Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.
</p>
<p>
By the other mode, forgotten is that love<br>
    Which Nature makes, and what is after added,<br>
    From which there is a special faith engendered.
</p>
<p>
Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is<br>
    Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,<br>
    Whoe’er betrays for ever is consumed.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “My Master, clear enough proceeds<br>
    Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes<br>
    This cavern and the people who possess it.
</p>
<p>
But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,<br>
    Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,<br>
    And who encounter with such bitter tongues,
</p>
<p>
Wherefore are they inside of the red city<br>
    Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,<br>
    And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?”
</p>
<p>
And unto me he said: “Why wanders so<br>
    Thine intellect from that which it is wont?<br>
    Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?
</p>
<p>
Hast thou no recollection of those words<br>
    With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses<br>
    The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,—
</p>
<p>
Incontinence, and Malice, and insane<br>
    Bestiality? and how Incontinence<br>
    Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?
</p>
<p>
If thou regardest this conclusion well,<br>
    And to thy mind recallest who they are<br>
    That up outside are undergoing penance,
</p>
<p>
Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons<br>
    They separated are, and why less wroth<br>
    Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.”
</p>
<p>
“O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,<br>
    Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,<br>
    That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!
</p>
<p>
Once more a little backward turn thee,” said I,<br>
    “There where thou sayest that usury offends<br>
    Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.”
</p>
<p>
“Philosophy,” he said, “to him who heeds it,<br>
    Noteth, not only in one place alone,<br>
    After what manner Nature takes her course
</p>
<p>
From Intellect Divine, and from its art;<br>
    And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,<br>
    After not many pages shalt thou find,
</p>
<p>
That this your art as far as possible<br>
    Follows, as the disciple doth the master;<br>
    So that your art is, as it were, God’s grandchild.
</p>
<p>
From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind<br>
    Genesis at the beginning, it behoves<br>
    Mankind to gain their life and to advance;
</p>
<p>
And since the usurer takes another way,<br>
    Nature herself and in her follower<br>
    Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.
</p>
<p>
But follow, now, as I would fain go on,<br>
    For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,<br>
    And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,
</p>
<p>
And far beyond there we descend the crag.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XII">
<p>
The place where to descend the bank we came<br>
    Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,<br>
    Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.
</p>
<p>
Such as that ruin is which in the flank<br>
    Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,<br>
    Either by earthquake or by failing stay,
</p>
<p>
For from the mountain’s top, from which it moved,<br>
    Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,<br>
    Some path ’twould give to him who was above;
</p>
<p>
Even such was the descent of that ravine,<br>
    And on the border of the broken chasm<br>
    The infamy of Crete was stretched along,
</p>
<p>
Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;<br>
    And when he us beheld, he bit himself,<br>
    Even as one whom anger racks within.
</p>
<p>
My Sage towards him shouted: “Peradventure<br>
    Thou think’st that here may be the Duke of Athens,<br>
    Who in the world above brought death to thee?
</p>
<p>
Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not<br>
    Instructed by thy sister, but he comes<br>
    In order to behold your punishments.”
</p>
<p>
As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment<br>
    In which he has received the mortal blow,<br>
    Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,
</p>
<p>
The Minotaur beheld I do the like;<br>
    And he, the wary, cried: “Run to the passage;<br>
    While he wroth, ’tis well thou shouldst descend.”
</p>
<p>
Thus down we took our way o’er that discharge<br>
    Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves<br>
    Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.
</p>
<p>
Thoughtful I went; and he said: “Thou art thinking<br>
    Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded<br>
    By that brute anger which just now I quenched.
</p>
<p>
Now will I have thee know, the other time<br>
    I here descended to the nether Hell,<br>
    This precipice had not yet fallen down.
</p>
<p>
But truly, if I well discern, a little<br>
    Before His coming who the mighty spoil<br>
    Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,
</p>
<p>
Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley<br>
    Trembled so, that I thought the Universe<br>
    Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think
</p>
<p>
The world ofttimes converted into chaos;<br>
    And at that moment this primeval crag<br>
    Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.
</p>
<p>
But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near<br>
    The river of blood, within which boiling is<br>
    Whoe’er by violence doth injure others.”
</p>
<p>
O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,<br>
    That spurs us onward so in our short life,<br>
    And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!
</p>
<p>
I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,<br>
    As one which all the plain encompasses,<br>
    Conformable to what my Guide had said.
</p>
<p>
And between this and the embankment’s foot<br>
    Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,<br>
    As in the world they used the chase to follow.
</p>
<p>
Beholding us descend, each one stood still,<br>
    And from the squadron three detached themselves,<br>
    With bows and arrows in advance selected;
</p>
<p>
And from afar one cried: “Unto what torment<br>
    Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?<br>
    Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.”
</p>
<p>
My Master said: “Our answer will we make<br>
    To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,<br>
    That will of thine was evermore so hasty.”
</p>
<p>
Then touched he me, and said: “This one is Nessus,<br>
    Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,<br>
    And for himself, himself did vengeance take.
</p>
<p>
And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,<br>
    Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;<br>
    That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.
</p>
<p>
Thousands and thousands go about the moat<br>
    Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges<br>
    Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.”
</p>
<p>
Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;<br>
    Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch<br>
    Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.
</p>
<p>
After he had uncovered his great mouth,<br>
    He said to his companions: “Are you ware<br>
    That he behind moveth whate’er he touches?
</p>
<p>
Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.”<br>
    And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,<br>
    Where the two natures are together joined,
</p>
<p>
Replied: “Indeed he lives, and thus alone<br>
    Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;<br>
    Necessity, and not delight, impels us.
</p>
<p>
Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,<br>
    Who unto me committed this new office;<br>
    No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.
</p>
<p>
But by that virtue through which I am moving<br>
    My steps along this savage thoroughfare,<br>
    Give us some one of thine, to be with us,
</p>
<p>
And who may show us where to pass the ford,<br>
    And who may carry this one on his back;<br>
    For ’tis no spirit that can walk the air.”
</p>
<p>
Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,<br>
    And said to Nessus: “Turn and do thou guide them,<br>
    And warn aside, if other band may meet you.”
</p>
<p>
We with our faithful escort onward moved<br>
    Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,<br>
    Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.
</p>
<p>
People I saw within up to the eyebrows,<br>
    And the great Centaur said: “Tyrants are these,<br>
    Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.
</p>
<p>
Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here<br>
    Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius<br>
    Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.
</p>
<p>
That forehead there which has the hair so black<br>
    Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,<br>
    Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,
</p>
<p>
Up in the world was by his stepson slain.”<br>
    Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,<br>
    “Now he be first to thee, and second I.”
</p>
<p>
A little farther on the Centaur stopped<br>
    Above a folk, who far down as the throat<br>
    Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.
</p>
<p>
A shade he showed us on one side alone,<br>
    Saying: “He cleft asunder in God’s bosom<br>
    The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.”
</p>
<p>
Then people saw I, who from out the river<br>
    Lifted their heads and also all the chest;<br>
    And many among these I recognised.
</p>
<p>
Thus ever more and more grew shallower<br>
    That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;<br>
    And there across the moat our passage was.
</p>
<p>
“Even as thou here upon this side beholdest<br>
    The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,”<br>
    The Centaur said, “I wish thee to believe
</p>
<p>
That on this other more and more declines<br>
    Its bed, until it reunites itself<br>
    Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.
</p>
<p>
Justice divine, upon this side, is goading<br>
    That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,<br>
    And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks
</p>
<p>
The tears which with the boiling it unseals<br>
    In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,<br>
    Who made upon the highways so much war.”
</p>
<p>
Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XIII">
<p>
Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,<br>
    When we had put ourselves within a wood,<br>
    That was not marked by any path whatever.
</p>
<p>
Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,<br>
    Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,<br>
    Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.
</p>
<p>
Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,<br>
    Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold<br>
    ’Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.
</p>
<p>
There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,<br>
    Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,<br>
    With sad announcement of impending doom;
</p>
<p>
Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,<br>
    And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;<br>
    They make laments upon the wondrous trees.
</p>
<p>
And the good Master: “Ere thou enter farther,<br>
    Know that thou art within the second round,”<br>
    Thus he began to say, “and shalt be, till
</p>
<p>
Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;<br>
    Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see<br>
    Things that will credence give unto my speech.”
</p>
<p>
I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,<br>
    And person none beheld I who might make them,<br>
    Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.
</p>
<p>
I think he thought that I perhaps might think<br>
    So many voices issued through those trunks<br>
    From people who concealed themselves from us;
</p>
<p>
Therefore the Master said: “If thou break off<br>
    Some little spray from any of these trees,<br>
    The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.”
</p>
<p>
Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,<br>
    And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;<br>
    And the trunk cried, “Why dost thou mangle me?”
</p>
<p>
After it had become embrowned with blood,<br>
    It recommenced its cry: “Why dost thou rend me?<br>
    Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?
</p>
<p>
Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;<br>
    Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,<br>
    Even if the souls of serpents we had been.”
</p>
<p>
As out of a green brand, that is on fire<br>
    At one of the ends, and from the other drips<br>
    And hisses with the wind that is escaping;
</p>
<p>
So from that splinter issued forth together<br>
    Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip<br>
    Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.
</p>
<p>
“Had he been able sooner to believe,”<br>
    My Sage made answer, “O thou wounded soul,<br>
    What only in my verses he has seen,
</p>
<p>
Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;<br>
    Whereas the thing incredible has caused me<br>
    To put him to an act which grieveth me.
</p>
<p>
But tell him who thou wast, so that by way<br>
    Of some amends thy fame he may refresh<br>
    Up in the world, to which he can return.”
</p>
<p>
And the trunk said: “So thy sweet words allure me,<br>
    I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,<br>
    That I a little to discourse am tempted.
</p>
<p>
I am the one who both keys had in keeping<br>
    Of Frederick’s heart, and turned them to and fro<br>
    So softly in unlocking and in locking,
</p>
<p>
That from his secrets most men I withheld;<br>
    Fidelity I bore the glorious office<br>
    So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.
</p>
<p>
The courtesan who never from the dwelling<br>
    Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,<br>
    Death universal and the vice of courts,
</p>
<p>
Inflamed against me all the other minds,<br>
    And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,<br>
    That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.
</p>
<p>
My spirit, in disdainful exultation,<br>
    Thinking by dying to escape disdain,<br>
    Made me unjust against myself, the just.
</p>
<p>
I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,<br>
    Do swear to you that never broke I faith<br>
    Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;
</p>
<p>
And to the world if one of you return,<br>
    Let him my memory comfort, which is lying<br>
    Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.”
</p>
<p>
Waited awhile, and then: “Since he is silent,”<br>
    The Poet said to me, “lose not the time,<br>
    But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.”
</p>
<p>
Whence I to him: “Do thou again inquire<br>
    Concerning what thou thinks’t will satisfy me;<br>
    For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.”
</p>
<p>
Therefore he recommenced: “So may the man<br>
    Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,<br>
    Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased
</p>
<p>
To tell us in what way the soul is bound<br>
    Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,<br>
    If any from such members e’er is freed.”
</p>
<p>
Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward<br>
    The wind was into such a voice converted:<br>
    “With brevity shall be replied to you.
</p>
<p>
When the exasperated soul abandons<br>
    The body whence it rent itself away,<br>
    Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.
</p>
<p>
It falls into the forest, and no part<br>
    Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,<br>
    There like a grain of spelt it germinates.
</p>
<p>
It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;<br>
    The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,<br>
    Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
</p>
<p>
Like others for our spoils shall we return;<br>
    But not that any one may them revest,<br>
    For ’tis not just to have what one casts off.
</p>
<p>
Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal<br>
    Forest our bodies shall suspended be,<br>
    Each to the thorn of his molested shade.”
</p>
<p>
We were attentive still unto the trunk,<br>
    Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,<br>
    When by a tumult we were overtaken,
</p>
<p>
In the same way as he is who perceives<br>
    The boar and chase approaching to his stand,<br>
    Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;
</p>
<p>
And two behold! upon our left-hand side,<br>
    Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,<br>
    That of the forest, every fan they broke.
</p>
<p>
He who was in advance: “Now help, Death, help!”<br>
    And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,<br>
    Was shouting: “Lano, were not so alert
</p>
<p>
Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!”<br>
    And then, perchance because his breath was failing,<br>
    He grouped himself together with a bush.
</p>
<p>
Behind them was the forest full of black<br>
    She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot<br>
    As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.
</p>
<p>
On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,<br>
    And him they lacerated piece by piece,<br>
    Thereafter bore away those aching members.
</p>
<p>
Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,<br>
    And led me to the bush, that all in vain<br>
    Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.
</p>
<p>
“O Jacopo,” it said, “of Sant’ Andrea,<br>
    What helped it thee of me to make a screen?<br>
    What blame have I in thy nefarious life?”
</p>
<p>
When near him had the Master stayed his steps,<br>
    He said: “Who wast thou, that through wounds so many<br>
    Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?”
</p>
<p>
And he to us: “O souls, that hither come<br>
    To look upon the shameful massacre<br>
    That has so rent away from me my leaves,
</p>
<p>
Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;<br>
    I of that city was which to the Baptist<br>
    Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
</p>
<p>
Forever with his art will make it sad.<br>
    And were it not that on the pass of Arno<br>
    Some glimpses of him are remaining still,
</p>
<p>
Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it<br>
    Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br>
    In vain had caused their labour to be done.
</p>
<p>
Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XIV">
<p>
Because the charity of my native place<br>
    Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,<br>
    And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.
</p>
<p>
Then came we to the confine, where disparted<br>
    The second round is from the third, and where<br>
    A horrible form of Justice is beheld.
</p>
<p>
Clearly to manifest these novel things,<br>
    I say that we arrived upon a plain,<br>
    Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;
</p>
<p>
The dolorous forest is a garland to it<br>
    All round about, as the sad moat to that;<br>
    There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.
</p>
<p>
The soil was of an arid and thick sand,<br>
    Not of another fashion made than that<br>
    Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.
</p>
<p>
Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou<br>
    By each one to be dreaded, who doth read<br>
    That which was manifest unto mine eyes!
</p>
<p>
Of naked souls beheld I many herds,<br>
    Who all were weeping very miserably,<br>
    And over them seemed set a law diverse.
</p>
<p>
Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;<br>
    And some were sitting all drawn up together,<br>
    And others went about continually.
</p>
<p>
Those who were going round were far the more,<br>
    And those were less who lay down to their torment,<br>
    But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.
</p>
<p>
O’er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,<br>
    Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,<br>
    As of the snow on Alp without a wind.
</p>
<p>
As Alexander, in those torrid parts<br>
    Of India, beheld upon his host<br>
    Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.
</p>
<p>
Whence he provided with his phalanxes<br>
    To trample down the soil, because the vapour<br>
    Better extinguished was while it was single;
</p>
<p>
Thus was descending the eternal heat,<br>
    Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder<br>
    Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.
</p>
<p>
Without repose forever was the dance<br>
    Of miserable hands, now there, now here,<br>
    Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.
</p>
<p>
“Master,” began I, “thou who overcomest<br>
    All things except the demons dire, that issued<br>
    Against us at the entrance of the gate,
</p>
<p>
Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not<br>
    The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,<br>
    So that the rain seems not to ripen him?”
</p>
<p>
And he himself, who had become aware<br>
    That I was questioning my Guide about him,<br>
    Cried: “Such as I was living, am I, dead.
</p>
<p>
If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom<br>
    He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,<br>
    Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,
</p>
<p>
And if he wearied out by turns the others<br>
    In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,<br>
    Vociferating, ‘Help, good Vulcan, help!’
</p>
<p>
Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,<br>
    And shot his bolts at me with all his might,<br>
    He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.”
</p>
<p>
Then did my Leader speak with such great force,<br>
    That I had never heard him speak so loud:<br>
    “O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished
</p>
<p>
Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;<br>
    Not any torment, saving thine own rage,<br>
    Would be unto thy fury pain complete.”
</p>
<p>
Then he turned round to me with better lip,<br>
    Saying: “One of the Seven Kings was he<br>
    Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold
</p>
<p>
God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;<br>
    But, as I said to him, his own despites<br>
    Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.
</p>
<p>
Now follow me, and mind thou do not place<br>
    As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,<br>
    But always keep them close unto the wood.”
</p>
<p>
Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes<br>
    Forth from the wood a little rivulet,<br>
    Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.
</p>
<p>
As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,<br>
    The sinful women later share among them,<br>
    So downward through the sand it went its way.
</p>
<p>
The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,<br>
    Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;<br>
    Whence I perceived that there the passage was.
</p>
<p>
“In all the rest which I have shown to thee<br>
    Since we have entered in within the gate<br>
    Whose threshold unto no one is denied,
</p>
<p>
Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes<br>
    So notable as is the present river,<br>
    Which all the little flames above it quenches.”
</p>
<p>
These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him<br>
    That he would give me largess of the food,<br>
    For which he had given me largess of desire.
</p>
<p>
“In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,”<br>
    Said he thereafterward, “whose name is Crete,<br>
    Under whose king the world of old was chaste.
</p>
<p>
There is a mountain there, that once was glad<br>
    With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;<br>
    Now ’tis deserted, as a thing worn out.
</p>
<p>
Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle<br>
    Of her own son; and to conceal him better,<br>
    Whene’er he cried, she there had clamours made.
</p>
<p>
A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<br>
    Who holds his shoulders turned tow’rds Damietta,<br>
    And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.
</p>
<p>
His head is fashioned of refined gold,<br>
    And of pure silver are the arms and breast;<br>
    Then he is brass as far down as the fork.
</p>
<p>
From that point downward all is chosen iron,<br>
    Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,<br>
    And more he stands on that than on the other.
</p>
<p>
Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure<br>
    Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<br>
    Which gathered together perforate that cavern.
</p>
<p>
From rock to rock they fall into this valley;<br>
    Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;<br>
    Then downward go along this narrow sluice
</p>
<p>
Unto that point where is no more descending.<br>
    They form Cocytus; what that pool may be<br>
    Thou shalt behold, so here ’tis not narrated.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “If so the present runnel<br>
    Doth take its rise in this way from our world,<br>
    Why only on this verge appears it to us?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Thou knowest the place is round,<br>
    And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,<br>
    Still to the left descending to the bottom,
</p>
<p>
Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.<br>
    Therefore if something new appear to us,<br>
    It should not bring amazement to thy face.”
</p>
<p>
And I again: “Master, where shall be found<br>
    Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou’rt silent,<br>
    And sayest the other of this rain is made?”
</p>
<p>
“In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,”<br>
    Replied he; “but the boiling of the red<br>
    Water might well solve one of them thou makest.
</p>
<p>
Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<br>
    There where the souls repair to lave themselves,<br>
    When sin repented of has been removed.”
</p>
<p>
Then said he: “It is time now to abandon<br>
    The wood; take heed that thou come after me;<br>
    A way the margins make that are not burning,
</p>
<p>
And over them all vapours are extinguished.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XV">
<p>
Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,<br>
    And so the brooklet’s mist o’ershadows it,<br>
    From fire it saves the water and the dikes.
</p>
<p>
Even as the Flemings, ’twixt Cadsand and Bruges,<br>
    Fearing the flood that tow’rds them hurls itself,<br>
    Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;
</p>
<p>
And as the Paduans along the Brenta,<br>
    To guard their villas and their villages,<br>
    Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;
</p>
<p>
In such similitude had those been made,<br>
    Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,<br>
    Whoever he might be, the master made them.
</p>
<p>
Now were we from the forest so remote,<br>
    I could not have discovered where it was,<br>
    Even if backward I had turned myself,
</p>
<p>
When we a company of souls encountered,<br>
    Who came beside the dike, and every one<br>
    Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont
</p>
<p>
To eye each other under a new moon,<br>
    And so towards us sharpened they their brows<br>
    As an old tailor at the needle’s eye.
</p>
<p>
Thus scrutinised by such a family,<br>
    By some one I was recognised, who seized<br>
    My garment’s hem, and cried out, “What a marvel!”
</p>
<p>
And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,<br>
    On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,<br>
    That the scorched countenance prevented not
</p>
<p>
His recognition by my intellect;<br>
    And bowing down my face unto his own,<br>
    I made reply, “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?”
</p>
<p>
And he: “May’t not displease thee, O my son,<br>
    If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini<br>
    Backward return and let the trail go on.”
</p>
<p>
I said to him: “With all my power I ask it;<br>
    And if you wish me to sit down with you,<br>
    I will, if he please, for I go with him.”
</p>
<p>
“O son,” he said, “whoever of this herd<br>
    A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,<br>
    Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.
</p>
<p>
Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,<br>
    And afterward will I rejoin my band,<br>
    Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.”
</p>
<p>
I did not dare to go down from the road<br>
    Level to walk with him; but my head bowed<br>
    I held as one who goeth reverently.
</p>
<p>
And he began: “What fortune or what fate<br>
    Before the last day leadeth thee down here?<br>
    And who is this that showeth thee the way?”
</p>
<p>
“Up there above us in the life serene,”<br>
    I answered him, “I lost me in a valley,<br>
    Or ever yet my age had been completed.
</p>
<p>
But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;<br>
    This one appeared to me, returning thither,<br>
    And homeward leadeth me along this road.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “If thou thy star do follow,<br>
    Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,<br>
    If well I judged in the life beautiful.
</p>
<p>
And if I had not died so prematurely,<br>
    Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,<br>
    I would have given thee comfort in the work.
</p>
<p>
But that ungrateful and malignant people,<br>
    Which of old time from Fesole descended,<br>
    And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,
</p>
<p>
Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;<br>
    And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs<br>
    It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.
</p>
<p>
Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;<br>
    A people avaricious, envious, proud;<br>
    Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.
</p>
<p>
Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,<br>
    One party and the other shall be hungry<br>
    For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.
</p>
<p>
Their litter let the beasts of Fesole<br>
    Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,<br>
    If any still upon their dunghill rise,
</p>
<p>
In which may yet revive the consecrated<br>
    Seed of those Romans, who remained there when<br>
    The nest of such great malice it became.”
</p>
<p>
“If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,”<br>
    Replied I to him, “not yet would you be<br>
    In banishment from human nature placed;
</p>
<p>
For in my mind is fixed, and touches now<br>
    My heart the dear and good paternal image<br>
    Of you, when in the world from hour to hour
</p>
<p>
You taught me how a man becomes eternal;<br>
    And how much I am grateful, while I live<br>
    Behoves that in my language be discerned.
</p>
<p>
What you narrate of my career I write,<br>
    And keep it to be glossed with other text<br>
    By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.
</p>
<p>
This much will I have manifest to you;<br>
    Provided that my conscience do not chide me,<br>
    For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.
</p>
<p>
Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;<br>
    Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around<br>
    As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.”
</p>
<p>
My Master thereupon on his right cheek<br>
    Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;<br>
    Then said: “He listeneth well who noteth it.”
</p>
<p>
Nor speaking less on that account, I go<br>
    With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are<br>
    His most known and most eminent companions.
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “To know of some is well;<br>
    Of others it were laudable to be silent,<br>
    For short would be the time for so much speech.
</p>
<p>
Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,<br>
    And men of letters great and of great fame,<br>
    In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.
</p>
<p>
Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,<br>
    And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there<br>
    If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,
</p>
<p>
That one, who by the Servant of the Servants<br>
    From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,<br>
    Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.
</p>
<p>
More would I say, but coming and discoursing<br>
    Can be no longer; for that I behold<br>
    New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.
</p>
<p>
A people comes with whom I may not be;<br>
    Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,<br>
    In which I still live, and no more I ask.”
</p>
<p>
Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those<br>
    Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle<br>
    Across the plain; and seemed to be among them
</p>
<p>
The one who wins, and not the one who loses.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XVI">
<p>
Now was I where was heard the reverberation<br>
    Of water falling into the next round,<br>
    Like to that humming which the beehives make,
</p>
<p>
When shadows three together started forth,<br>
    Running, from out a company that passed<br>
    Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.
</p>
<p>
Towards us came they, and each one cried out:<br>
    “Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest<br>
    To be some one of our depraved city.”
</p>
<p>
Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,<br>
    Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!<br>
    It pains me still but to remember it.
</p>
<p>
Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;<br>
    He turned his face towards me, and “Now wait,”<br>
    He said; “to these we should be courteous.
</p>
<p>
And if it were not for the fire that darts<br>
    The nature of this region, I should say<br>
    That haste were more becoming thee than them.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as we stood still, they recommenced<br>
    The old refrain, and when they overtook us,<br>
    Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.
</p>
<p>
As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,<br>
    Watching for their advantage and their hold,<br>
    Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,
</p>
<p>
Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage<br>
    Direct to me, so that in opposite wise<br>
    His neck and feet continual journey made.
</p>
<p>
And, “If the misery of this soft place<br>
    Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,”<br>
    Began one, “and our aspect black and blistered,
</p>
<p>
Let the renown of us thy mind incline<br>
    To tell us who thou art, who thus securely<br>
    Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.
</p>
<p>
He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,<br>
    Naked and skinless though he now may go,<br>
    Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;
</p>
<p>
He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;<br>
    His name was Guidoguerra, and in life<br>
    Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.
</p>
<p>
The other, who close by me treads the sand,<br>
    Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame<br>
    Above there in the world should welcome be.
</p>
<p>
And I, who with them on the cross am placed,<br>
    Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly<br>
    My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.”
</p>
<p>
Could I have been protected from the fire,<br>
    Below I should have thrown myself among them,<br>
    And think the Teacher would have suffered it;
</p>
<p>
But as I should have burned and baked myself,<br>
    My terror overmastered my good will,<br>
    Which made me greedy of embracing them.
</p>
<p>
Then I began: “Sorrow and not disdain<br>
    Did your condition fix within me so,<br>
    That tardily it wholly is stripped off,
</p>
<p>
As soon as this my Lord said unto me<br>
    Words, on account of which I thought within me<br>
    That people such as you are were approaching.
</p>
<p>
I of your city am; and evermore<br>
    Your labours and your honourable names<br>
    I with affection have retraced and heard.
</p>
<p>
I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits<br>
    Promised to me by the veracious Leader;<br>
    But to the centre first I needs must plunge.”
</p>
<p>
“So may the soul for a long while conduct<br>
    Those limbs of thine,” did he make answer then,<br>
    “And so may thy renown shine after thee,
</p>
<p>
Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell<br>
    Within our city, as they used to do,<br>
    Or if they wholly have gone out of it;
</p>
<p>
For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment<br>
    With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,<br>
    Doth greatly mortify us with his words.”
</p>
<p>
“The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,<br>
    Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,<br>
    Florence, so that thou weep’st thereat already!”
</p>
<p>
In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;<br>
    And the three, taking that for my reply,<br>
    Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.
</p>
<p>
“If other times so little it doth cost thee,”<br>
    Replied they all, “to satisfy another,<br>
    Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,<br>
    And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,<br>
    When it shall pleasure thee to say, ‘I was,’
</p>
<p>
See that thou speak of us unto the people.”<br>
    Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight<br>
    It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.
</p>
<p>
Not an Amen could possibly be said<br>
    So rapidly as they had disappeared;<br>
    Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.
</p>
<p>
I followed him, and little had we gone,<br>
    Before the sound of water was so near us,<br>
    That speaking we should hardly have been heard.
</p>
<p>
Even as that stream which holdeth its own course<br>
    The first from Monte Veso tow’rds the East,<br>
    Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,
</p>
<p>
Which is above called Acquacheta, ere<br>
    It down descendeth into its low bed,<br>
    And at Forli is vacant of that name,
</p>
<p>
Reverberates there above San Benedetto<br>
    From Alps, by falling at a single leap,<br>
    Where for a thousand there were room enough;
</p>
<p>
Thus downward from a bank precipitate,<br>
    We found resounding that dark-tinted water,<br>
    So that it soon the ear would have offended.
</p>
<p>
I had a cord around about me girt,<br>
    And therewithal I whilom had designed<br>
    To take the panther with the painted skin.
</p>
<p>
After I this had all from me unloosed,<br>
    As my Conductor had commanded me,<br>
    I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,
</p>
<p>
Whereat he turned himself to the right side,<br>
    And at a little distance from the verge,<br>
    He cast it down into that deep abyss.
</p>
<p>
“It must needs be some novelty respond,”<br>
    I said within myself, “to the new signal<br>
    The Master with his eye is following so.”
</p>
<p>
Ah me! how very cautious men should be<br>
    With those who not alone behold the act,<br>
    But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!
</p>
<p>
He said to me: “Soon there will upward come<br>
    What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming<br>
    Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.”
</p>
<p>
Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,<br>
    A man should close his lips as far as may be,<br>
    Because without his fault it causes shame;
</p>
<p>
But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes<br>
    Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,<br>
    So may they not be void of lasting favour,
</p>
<p>
Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere<br>
    I saw a figure swimming upward come,<br>
    Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,
</p>
<p>
Even as he returns who goeth down<br>
    Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled<br>
    Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,
</p>
<p>
Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.

<p>
“Behold the monster with the pointed tail,<br>
    Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,<br>
    Behold him who infecteth all the world.”
</p>
<p>
Thus unto me my Guide began to say,<br>
    And beckoned him that he should come to shore,<br>
    Near to the confine of the trodden marble;
</p>
<p>
And that uncleanly image of deceit<br>
    Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,<br>
    But on the border did not drag its tail.
</p>
<p>
The face was as the face of a just man,<br>
    Its semblance outwardly was so benign,<br>
    And of a serpent all the trunk beside.
</p>
<p>
Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;<br>
    The back, and breast, and both the sides it had<br>
    Depicted o’er with nooses and with shields.
</p>
<p>
With colours more, groundwork or broidery<br>
    Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,<br>
    Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.
</p>
<p>
As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,<br>
    That part are in the water, part on land;<br>
    And as among the guzzling Germans there,
</p>
<p>
The beaver plants himself to wage his war;<br>
    So that vile monster lay upon the border,<br>
    Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.
</p>
<p>
His tail was wholly quivering in the void,<br>
    Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,<br>
    That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.
</p>
<p>
The Guide said: “Now perforce must turn aside<br>
    Our way a little, even to that beast<br>
    Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.”
</p>
<p>
We therefore on the right side descended,<br>
    And made ten steps upon the outer verge,<br>
    Completely to avoid the sand and flame;
</p>
<p>
And after we are come to him, I see<br>
    A little farther off upon the sand<br>
    A people sitting near the hollow place.
</p>
<p>
Then said to me the Master: “So that full<br>
    Experience of this round thou bear away,<br>
    Now go and see what their condition is.
</p>
<p>
There let thy conversation be concise;<br>
    Till thou returnest I will speak with him,<br>
    That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.”
</p>
<p>
Thus farther still upon the outermost<br>
    Head of that seventh circle all alone<br>
    I went, where sat the melancholy folk.
</p>
<p>
Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;<br>
    This way, that way, they helped them with their hands<br>
    Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.
</p>
<p>
Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,<br>
    Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when<br>
    By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.
</p>
<p>
When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces<br>
    Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,<br>
    Not one of them I knew; but I perceived
</p>
<p>
That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,<br>
    Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;<br>
    And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.
</p>
<p>
And as I gazing round me come among them,<br>
    Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw<br>
    That had the face and posture of a lion.
</p>
<p>
Proceeding then the current of my sight,<br>
    Another of them saw I, red as blood,<br>
    Display a goose more white than butter is.
</p>
<p>
And one, who with an azure sow and gravid<br>
    Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,<br>
    Said unto me: “What dost thou in this moat?
</p>
<p>
Now get thee gone; and since thou’rt still alive,<br>
    Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,<br>
    Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.
</p>
<p>
A Paduan am I with these Florentines;<br>
    Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,<br>
    Exclaiming, ‘Come the sovereign cavalier,
</p>
<p>
He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;’”<br>
    Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust<br>
    His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.
</p>
<p>
And fearing lest my longer stay might vex<br>
    Him who had warned me not to tarry long,<br>
    Backward I turned me from those weary souls.
</p>
<p>
I found my Guide, who had already mounted<br>
    Upon the back of that wild animal,<br>
    And said to me: “Now be both strong and bold.
</p>
<p>
Now we descend by stairways such as these;<br>
    Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,<br>
    So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.”
</p>
<p>
Such as he is who has so near the ague<br>
    Of quartan that his nails are blue already,<br>
    And trembles all, but looking at the shade;
</p>
<p>
Even such became I at those proffered words;<br>
    But shame in me his menaces produced,<br>
    Which maketh servant strong before good master.
</p>
<p>
I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;<br>
    I wished to say, and yet the voice came not<br>
    As I believed, “Take heed that thou embrace me.”
</p>
<p>
But he, who other times had rescued me<br>
    In other peril, soon as I had mounted,<br>
    Within his arms encircled and sustained me,
</p>
<p>
And said: “Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;<br>
    The circles large, and the descent be little;<br>
    Think of the novel burden which thou hast.”
</p>
<p>
Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,<br>
    Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;<br>
    And when he wholly felt himself afloat,
</p>
<p>
There where his breast had been he turned his tail,<br>
    And that extended like an eel he moved,<br>
    And with his paws drew to himself the air.
</p>
<p>
A greater fear I do not think there was<br>
    What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,<br>
    Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;
</p>
<p>
Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks<br>
    Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,<br>
    His father crying, “An ill way thou takest!”
</p>
<p>
Than was my own, when I perceived myself<br>
    On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished<br>
    The sight of everything but of the monster.
</p>
<p>
Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;<br>
    Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only<br>
    By wind upon my face and from below.
</p>
<p>
I heard already on the right the whirlpool<br>
    Making a horrible crashing under us;<br>
    Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.
</p>
<p>
Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;<br>
    Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,<br>
    Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.
</p>
<p>
I saw then, for before I had not seen it,<br>
    The turning and descending, by great horrors<br>
    That were approaching upon divers sides.
</p>
<p>
As falcon who has long been on the wing,<br>
    Who, without seeing either lure or bird,<br>
    Maketh the falconer say, “Ah me, thou stoopest,”
</p>
<p>
Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,<br>
    Thorough a hundred circles, and alights<br>
    Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;
</p>
<p>
Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,<br>
    Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,<br>
    And being disencumbered of our persons,
</p>
<p>
He sped away as arrow from the string.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XVIII">
<p>
There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,<br>
    Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,<br>
    As is the circle that around it turns.
</p>
<p>
Right in the middle of the field malign<br>
    There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,<br>
    Of which its place the structure will recount.
</p>
<p>
Round, then, is that enclosure which remains<br>
    Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,<br>
    And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.
</p>
<p>
As where for the protection of the walls<br>
    Many and many moats surround the castles,<br>
    The part in which they are a figure forms,
</p>
<p>
Just such an image those presented there;<br>
    And as about such strongholds from their gates<br>
    Unto the outer bank are little bridges,
</p>
<p>
So from the precipice’s base did crags<br>
    Project, which intersected dikes and moats,<br>
    Unto the well that truncates and collects them.
</p>
<p>
Within this place, down shaken from the back<br>
    Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet<br>
    Held to the left, and I moved on behind.
</p>
<p>
Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,<br>
    New torments, and new wielders of the lash,<br>
    Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.
</p>
<p>
Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;<br>
    This side the middle came they facing us,<br>
    Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;
</p>
<p>
Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,<br>
    The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,<br>
    Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;
</p>
<p>
For all upon one side towards the Castle<br>
    Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter’s;<br>
    On the other side they go towards the Mountain.
</p>
<p>
This side and that, along the livid stone<br>
    Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,<br>
    Who cruelly were beating them behind.
</p>
<p>
Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs<br>
    At the first blows! and sooth not any one<br>
    The second waited for, nor for the third.
</p>
<p>
While I was going on, mine eyes by one<br>
    Encountered were; and straight I said: “Already<br>
    With sight of this one I am not unfed.”
</p>
<p>
Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,<br>
    And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,<br>
    And to my going somewhat back assented;
</p>
<p>
And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,<br>
    Lowering his face, but little it availed him;<br>
    For said I: “Thou that castest down thine eyes,
</p>
<p>
If false are not the features which thou bearest,<br>
    Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;<br>
    But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Unwillingly I tell it;<br>
    But forces me thine utterance distinct,<br>
    Which makes me recollect the ancient world.
</p>
<p>
I was the one who the fair Ghisola<br>
    Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,<br>
    Howe’er the shameless story may be told.
</p>
<p>
Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;<br>
    Nay, rather is this place so full of them,<br>
    That not so many tongues to-day are taught
</p>
<p>
’Twixt Reno and Savena to say ‘sipa;’<br>
    And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,<br>
    Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.”
</p>
<p>
While speaking in this manner, with his scourge<br>
    A demon smote him, and said: “Get thee gone<br>
    Pander, there are no women here for coin.”
</p>
<p>
I joined myself again unto mine Escort;<br>
    Thereafterward with footsteps few we came<br>
    To where a crag projected from the bank.
</p>
<p>
This very easily did we ascend,<br>
    And turning to the right along its ridge,<br>
    From those eternal circles we departed.
</p>
<p>
When we were there, where it is hollowed out<br>
    Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,<br>
    The Guide said: “Wait, and see that on thee strike
</p>
<p>
The vision of those others evil-born,<br>
    Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,<br>
    Because together with us they have gone.”
</p>
<p>
From the old bridge we looked upon the train<br>
    Which tow’rds us came upon the other border,<br>
    And which the scourges in like manner smite.
</p>
<p>
And the good Master, without my inquiring,<br>
    Said to me: “See that tall one who is coming,<br>
    And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;
</p>
<p>
Still what a royal aspect he retains!<br>
    That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning<br>
    The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.
</p>
<p>
He by the isle of Lemnos passed along<br>
    After the daring women pitiless<br>
    Had unto death devoted all their males.
</p>
<p>
There with his tokens and with ornate words<br>
    Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden<br>
    Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.
</p>
<p>
There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;<br>
    Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,<br>
    And also for Medea is vengeance done.
</p>
<p>
With him go those who in such wise deceive;<br>
    And this sufficient be of the first valley<br>
    To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.”
</p>
<p>
We were already where the narrow path<br>
    Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms<br>
    Of that a buttress for another arch.
</p>
<p>
Thence we heard people, who are making moan<br>
    In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,<br>
    And with their palms beating upon themselves
</p>
<p>
The margins were incrusted with a mould<br>
    By exhalation from below, that sticks there,<br>
    And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.
</p>
<p>
The bottom is so deep, no place suffices<br>
    To give us sight of it, without ascending<br>
    The arch’s back, where most the crag impends.
</p>
<p>
Thither we came, and thence down in the moat<br>
    I saw a people smothered in a filth<br>
    That out of human privies seemed to flow;
</p>
<p>
And whilst below there with mine eye I search,<br>
    I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,<br>
    It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.
</p>
<p>
He screamed to me: “Wherefore art thou so eager<br>
    To look at me more than the other foul ones?”<br>
    And I to him: “Because, if I remember,
</p>
<p>
I have already seen thee with dry hair,<br>
    And thou’rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;<br>
    Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.”
</p>
<p>
And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:<br>
    “The flatteries have submerged me here below,<br>
    Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.”
</p>
<p>
Then said to me the Guide: “See that thou thrust<br>
    Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,<br>
    That with thine eyes thou well the face attain
</p>
<p>
Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,<br>
    Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,<br>
    And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.
</p>
<p>
Thais the harlot is it, who replied<br>
    Unto her paramour, when he said, ‘Have I<br>
    Great gratitude from thee?’—‘Nay, marvellous;’
</p>
<p>
And herewith let our sight be satisfied.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XIX">
<p>
O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,<br>
    Ye who the things of God, which ought to be<br>
    The brides of holiness, rapaciously
</p>
<p>
For silver and for gold do prostitute,<br>
    Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,<br>
    Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.
</p>
<p>
We had already on the following tomb<br>
    Ascended to that portion of the crag<br>
    Which o’er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.
</p>
<p>
Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest<br>
    In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,<br>
    And with what justice doth thy power distribute!
</p>
<p>
I saw upon the sides and on the bottom<br>
    The livid stone with perforations filled,<br>
    All of one size, and every one was round.
</p>
<p>
To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater<br>
    Than those that in my beautiful Saint John<br>
    Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,
</p>
<p>
And one of which, not many years ago,<br>
    I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;<br>
    Be this a seal all men to undeceive.
</p>
<p>
Out of the mouth of each one there protruded<br>
    The feet of a transgressor, and the legs<br>
    Up to the calf, the rest within remained.
</p>
<p>
In all of them the soles were both on fire;<br>
    Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,<br>
    They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.
</p>
<p>
Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont<br>
    To move upon the outer surface only,<br>
    So likewise was it there from heel to point.
</p>
<p>
“Master, who is that one who writhes himself,<br>
    More than his other comrades quivering,”<br>
    I said, “and whom a redder flame is sucking?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “If thou wilt have me bear thee<br>
    Down there along that bank which lowest lies,<br>
    From him thou’lt know his errors and himself.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;<br>
    Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not<br>
    From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.”
</p>
<p>
Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;<br>
    We turned, and on the left-hand side descended<br>
    Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.
</p>
<p>
And the good Master yet from off his haunch<br>
    Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me<br>
    Of him who so lamented with his shanks.
</p>
<p>
“Whoe’er thou art, that standest upside down,<br>
    O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,”<br>
    To say began I, “if thou canst, speak out.”
</p>
<p>
I stood even as the friar who is confessing<br>
    The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,<br>
    Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.
</p>
<p>
And he cried out: “Dost thou stand there already,<br>
    Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?<br>
    By many years the record lied to me.
</p>
<p>
Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,<br>
    For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud<br>
    The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?”
</p>
<p>
Such I became, as people are who stand,<br>
    Not comprehending what is answered them,<br>
    As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.
</p>
<p>
Then said Virgilius: “Say to him straightway,<br>
    ‘I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.’”<br>
    And I replied as was imposed on me.
</p>
<p>
Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,<br>
    Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation<br>
    Said to me: “Then what wantest thou of me?
</p>
<p>
If who I am thou carest so much to know,<br>
    That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,<br>
    Know that I vested was with the great mantle;
</p>
<p>
And truly was I son of the She-bear,<br>
    So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth<br>
    Above, and here myself, I pocketed.
</p>
<p>
Beneath my head the others are dragged down<br>
    Who have preceded me in simony,<br>
    Flattened along the fissure of the rock.
</p>
<p>
Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever<br>
    That one shall come who I believed thou wast,<br>
    What time the sudden question I proposed.
</p>
<p>
But longer I my feet already toast,<br>
    And here have been in this way upside down,<br>
    Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;
</p>
<p>
For after him shall come of fouler deed<br>
    From tow’rds the west a Pastor without law,<br>
    Such as befits to cover him and me.
</p>
<p>
New Jason will he be, of whom we read<br>
    In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,<br>
    So he who governs France shall be to this one.”
</p>
<p>
I do not know if I were here too bold,<br>
    That him I answered only in this metre:<br>
    “I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
</p>
<p>
Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,<br>
    Before he put the keys into his keeping?<br>
    Truly he nothing asked but ‘Follow me.’
</p>
<p>
Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias<br>
    Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen<br>
    Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.
</p>
<p>
Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,<br>
    And keep safe guard o’er the ill-gotten money,<br>
    Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
</p>
<p>
And were it not that still forbids it me<br>
    The reverence for the keys superlative<br>
    Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
</p>
<p>
I would make use of words more grievous still;<br>
    Because your avarice afflicts the world,<br>
    Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.
</p>
<p>
The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,<br>
    When she who sitteth upon many waters<br>
    To fornicate with kings by him was seen;
</p>
<p>
The same who with the seven heads was born,<br>
    And power and strength from the ten horns received,<br>
    So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.
</p>
<p>
Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;<br>
    And from the idolater how differ ye,<br>
    Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?
</p>
<p>
Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,<br>
    Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower<br>
    Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!”
</p>
<p>
And while I sang to him such notes as these,<br>
    Either that anger or that conscience stung him,<br>
    He struggled violently with both his feet.
</p>
<p>
I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,<br>
    With such contented lip he listened ever<br>
    Unto the sound of the true words expressed.
</p>
<p>
Therefore with both his arms he took me up,<br>
    And when he had me all upon his breast,<br>
    Remounted by the way where he descended.
</p>
<p>
Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;<br>
    But bore me to the summit of the arch<br>
    Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.
</p>
<p>
There tenderly he laid his burden down,<br>
    Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,<br>
    That would have been hard passage for the goats:
</p>
<p>
Thence was unveiled to me another valley.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XX">
<p>
Of a new pain behoves me to make verses<br>
    And give material to the twentieth canto<br>
    Of the first song, which is of the submerged.
</p>
<p>
I was already thoroughly disposed<br>
    To peer down into the uncovered depth,<br>
    Which bathed itself with tears of agony;
</p>
<p>
And people saw I through the circular valley,<br>
    Silent and weeping, coming at the pace<br>
    Which in this world the Litanies assume.
</p>
<p>
As lower down my sight descended on them,<br>
    Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted<br>
    From chin to the beginning of the chest;
</p>
<p>
For tow’rds the reins the countenance was turned,<br>
    And backward it behoved them to advance,<br>
    As to look forward had been taken from them.
</p>
<p>
Perchance indeed by violence of palsy<br>
    Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;<br>
    But I ne’er saw it, nor believe it can be.
</p>
<p>
As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit<br>
    From this thy reading, think now for thyself<br>
    How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,
</p>
<p>
When our own image near me I beheld<br>
    Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes<br>
    Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.
</p>
<p>
Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak<br>
    Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said<br>
    To me: “Art thou, too, of the other fools?
</p>
<p>
Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;<br>
    Who is a greater reprobate than he<br>
    Who feels compassion at the doom divine?
</p>
<p>
Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom<br>
    Opened the earth before the Thebans’ eyes;<br>
    Wherefore they all cried: ‘Whither rushest thou,
</p>
<p>
Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?’<br>
    And downward ceased he not to fall amain<br>
    As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.
</p>
<p>
See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!<br>
    Because he wished to see too far before him<br>
    Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:
</p>
<p>
Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,<br>
    When from a male a female he became,<br>
    His members being all of them transformed;
</p>
<p>
And afterwards was forced to strike once more<br>
    The two entangled serpents with his rod,<br>
    Ere he could have again his manly plumes.
</p>
<p>
That Aruns is, who backs the other’s belly,<br>
    Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs<br>
    The Carrarese who houses underneath,
</p>
<p>
Among the marbles white a cavern had<br>
    For his abode; whence to behold the stars<br>
    And sea, the view was not cut off from him.
</p>
<p>
And she there, who is covering up her breasts,<br>
    Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,<br>
    And on that side has all the hairy skin,
</p>
<p>
Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,<br>
    Afterwards tarried there where I was born;<br>
    Whereof I would thou list to me a little.
</p>
<p>
After her father had from life departed,<br>
    And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,<br>
    She a long season wandered through the world.
</p>
<p>
Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake<br>
    At the Alp’s foot that shuts in Germany<br>
    Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.
</p>
<p>
By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,<br>
    ’Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,<br>
    With water that grows stagnant in that lake.
</p>
<p>
Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,<br>
    And he of Brescia, and the Veronese<br>
    Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.
</p>
<p>
Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,<br>
    To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,<br>
    Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.
</p>
<p>
There of necessity must fall whatever<br>
    In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,<br>
    And grows a river down through verdant pastures.
</p>
<p>
Soon as the water doth begin to run,<br>
    No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,<br>
    Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.
</p>
<p>
Not far it runs before it finds a plain<br>
    In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,<br>
    And oft ’tis wont in summer to be sickly.
</p>
<p>
Passing that way the virgin pitiless<br>
    Land in the middle of the fen descried,<br>
    Untilled and naked of inhabitants;
</p>
<p>
There to escape all human intercourse,<br>
    She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise<br>
    And lived, and left her empty body there.
</p>
<p>
The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,<br>
    Collected in that place, which was made strong<br>
    By the lagoon it had on every side;
</p>
<p>
They built their city over those dead bones,<br>
    And, after her who first the place selected,<br>
    Mantua named it, without other omen.
</p>
<p>
Its people once within more crowded were,<br>
    Ere the stupidity of Casalodi<br>
    From Pinamonte had received deceit.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I caution thee, if e’er thou hearest<br>
    Originate my city otherwise,<br>
    No falsehood may the verity defraud.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “My Master, thy discourses are<br>
    To me so certain, and so take my faith,<br>
    That unto me the rest would be spent coals.
</p>
<p>
But tell me of the people who are passing,<br>
    If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,<br>
    For only unto that my mind reverts.”
</p>
<p>
Then said he to me: “He who from the cheek<br>
    Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders<br>
    Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,
</p>
<p>
So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,<br>
    An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,<br>
    In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.
</p>
<p>
Eryphylus his name was, and so sings<br>
    My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;<br>
    That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.
</p>
<p>
The next, who is so slender in the flanks,<br>
    Was Michael Scott, who of a verity<br>
    Of magical illusions knew the game.
</p>
<p>
Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,<br>
    Who now unto his leather and his thread<br>
    Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.
</p>
<p>
Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,<br>
    The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;<br>
    They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.
</p>
<p>
But come now, for already holds the confines<br>
    Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville<br>
    Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,
</p>
<p>
And yesternight the moon was round already;<br>
    Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee<br>
    From time to time within the forest deep.”
</p>
<p>
Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXI">
<p>
From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things<br>
    Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,<br>
    We came along, and held the summit, when
</p>
<p>
We halted to behold another fissure<br>
    Of Malebolge and other vain laments;<br>
    And I beheld it marvellously dark.
</p>
<p>
As in the Arsenal of the Venetians<br>
    Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch<br>
    To smear their unsound vessels o’er again,
</p>
<p>
For sail they cannot; and instead thereof<br>
    One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks<br>
    The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;
</p>
<p>
One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,<br>
    This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,<br>
    Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;
</p>
<p>
Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,<br>
    Was boiling down below there a dense pitch<br>
    Which upon every side the bank belimed.
</p>
<p>
I saw it, but I did not see within it<br>
    Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,<br>
    And all swell up and resubside compressed.
</p>
<p>
The while below there fixedly I gazed,<br>
    My Leader, crying out: “Beware, beware!”<br>
    Drew me unto himself from where I stood.
</p>
<p>
Then I turned round, as one who is impatient<br>
    To see what it behoves him to escape,<br>
    And whom a sudden terror doth unman,
</p>
<p>
Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;<br>
    And I beheld behind us a black devil,<br>
    Running along upon the crag, approach.
</p>
<p>
Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!<br>
    And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,<br>
    With open wings and light upon his feet!
</p>
<p>
His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,<br>
    A sinner did encumber with both haunches,<br>
    And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.
</p>
<p>
From off our bridge, he said: “O Malebranche,<br>
    Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;<br>
    Plunge him beneath, for I return for others
</p>
<p>
Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.<br>
    All there are barrators, except Bonturo;<br>
    No into Yes for money there is changed.”
</p>
<p>
He hurled him down, and over the hard crag<br>
    Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened<br>
    In so much hurry to pursue a thief.
</p>
<p>
The other sank, and rose again face downward;<br>
    But the demons, under cover of the bridge,<br>
    Cried: “Here the Santo Volto has no place!
</p>
<p>
Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;<br>
    Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,<br>
    Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.”
</p>
<p>
They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;<br>
    They said: “It here behoves thee to dance covered,<br>
    That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.”
</p>
<p>
Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make<br>
    Immerse into the middle of the caldron<br>
    The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.
</p>
<p>
Said the good Master to me: “That it be not<br>
    Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down<br>
    Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;
</p>
<p>
And for no outrage that is done to me<br>
    Be thou afraid, because these things I know,<br>
    For once before was I in such a scuffle.”
</p>
<p>
Then he passed on beyond the bridge’s head,<br>
    And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,<br>
    Need was for him to have a steadfast front.
</p>
<p>
With the same fury, and the same uproar,<br>
    As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,<br>
    Who on a sudden begs, where’er he stops,
</p>
<p>
They issued from beneath the little bridge,<br>
    And turned against him all their grappling-irons;<br>
    But he cried out: “Be none of you malignant!
</p>
<p>
Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,<br>
    Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,<br>
    And then take counsel as to grappling me.”
</p>
<p>
They all cried out: “Let Malacoda go;”<br>
    Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,<br>
    And he came to him, saying: “What avails it?”
</p>
<p>
“Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me<br>
    Advanced into this place,” my Master said,<br>
    “Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,
</p>
<p>
Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?<br>
    Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed<br>
    That I another show this savage road.”
</p>
<p>
Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,<br>
    That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,<br>
    And to the others said: “Now strike him not.”
</p>
<p>
And unto me my Guide: “O thou, who sittest<br>
    Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,<br>
    Securely now return to me again.”
</p>
<p>
Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;<br>
    And all the devils forward thrust themselves,<br>
    So that I feared they would not keep their compact.
</p>
<p>
And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers<br>
    Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,<br>
    Seeing themselves among so many foes.
</p>
<p>
Close did I press myself with all my person<br>
    Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes<br>
    From off their countenance, which was not good.
</p>
<p>
They lowered their rakes, and “Wilt thou have me hit him,”<br>
    They said to one another, “on the rump?”<br>
    And answered: “Yes; see that thou nick him with it.”
</p>
<p>
But the same demon who was holding parley<br>
    With my Conductor turned him very quickly,<br>
    And said: “Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;”
</p>
<p>
Then said to us: “You can no farther go<br>
    Forward upon this crag, because is lying<br>
    All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.
</p>
<p>
And if it still doth please you to go onward,<br>
    Pursue your way along upon this rock;<br>
    Near is another crag that yields a path.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,<br>
    One thousand and two hundred sixty-six<br>
    Years were complete, that here the way was broken.
</p>
<p>
I send in that direction some of mine<br>
    To see if any one doth air himself;<br>
    Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.
</p>
<p>
Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,”<br>
    Began he to cry out, “and thou, Cagnazzo;<br>
    And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.
</p>
<p>
Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,<br>
    And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,<br>
    And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;
</p>
<p>
Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;<br>
    Let these be safe as far as the next crag,<br>
    That all unbroken passes o’er the dens.”
</p>
<p>
“O me! what is it, Master, that I see?<br>
    Pray let us go,” I said, “without an escort,<br>
    If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.
</p>
<p>
If thou art as observant as thy wont is,<br>
    Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,<br>
    And with their brows are threatening woe to us?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “I will not have thee fear;<br>
    Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,<br>
    Because they do it for those boiling wretches.”
</p>
<p>
Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;<br>
    But first had each one thrust his tongue between<br>
    His teeth towards their leader for a signal;
</p>
<p>
And he had made a trumpet of his rump.
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXII">
<p>
I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,<br>
    Begin the storming, and their muster make,<br>
    And sometimes starting off for their escape;
</p>
<p>
Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,<br>
    O Aretines, and foragers go forth,<br>
    Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,
</p>
<p>
Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,<br>
    With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,<br>
    And with our own, and with outlandish things,
</p>
<p>
But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth<br>
    Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,<br>
    Nor ship by any sign of land or star.
</p>
<p>
We went upon our way with the ten demons;<br>
    Ah, savage company! but in the church<br>
    With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!
</p>
<p>
Ever upon the pitch was my intent,<br>
    To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,<br>
    And of the people who therein were burned.
</p>
<p>
Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign<br>
    To mariners by arching of the back,<br>
    That they should counsel take to save their vessel,
</p>
<p>
Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,<br>
    One of the sinners would display his back,<br>
    And in less time conceal it than it lightens.
</p>
<p>
As on the brink of water in a ditch<br>
    The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,<br>
    So that they hide their feet and other bulk,
</p>
<p>
So upon every side the sinners stood;<br>
    But ever as Barbariccia near them came,<br>
    Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.
</p>
<p>
I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,<br>
    One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass<br>
    One frog remains, and down another dives;
</p>
<p>
And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,<br>
    Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,<br>
    And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.
</p>
<p>
I knew, before, the names of all of them,<br>
    So had I noted them when they were chosen,<br>
    And when they called each other, listened how.
</p>
<p>
“O Rubicante, see that thou do lay<br>
    Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,”<br>
    Cried all together the accursed ones.
</p>
<p>
And I: “My Master, see to it, if thou canst,<br>
    That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,<br>
    Thus come into his adversaries’ hands.”
</p>
<p>
Near to the side of him my Leader drew,<br>
    Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:<br>
    “I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;
</p>
<p>
My mother placed me servant to a lord,<br>
    For she had borne me to a ribald knave,<br>
    Destroyer of himself and of his things.
</p>
<p>
Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;<br>
    I set me there to practise barratry,<br>
    For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.”
</p>
<p>
And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,<br>
    On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,<br>
    Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.
</p>
<p>
Among malicious cats the mouse had come;<br>
    But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,<br>
    And said: “Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.”
</p>
<p>
And to my Master he turned round his head;<br>
    “Ask him again,” he said, “if more thou wish<br>
    To know from him, before some one destroy him.”
</p>
<p>
The Guide: “Now tell then of the other culprits;<br>
    Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,<br>
    Under the pitch?”  And he: “I separated
</p>
<p>
Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;<br>
    Would that I still were covered up with him,<br>
    For I should fear not either claw nor hook!”
</p>
<p>
And Libicocco: “We have borne too much;”<br>
    And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,<br>
    So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.
</p>
<p>
Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him<br>
    Down at the legs; whence their Decurion<br>
    Turned round and round about with evil look.
</p>
<p>
When they again somewhat were pacified,<br>
    Of him, who still was looking at his wound,<br>
    Demanded my Conductor without stay:
</p>
<p>
“Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting<br>
    Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?”<br>
    And he replied: “It was the Friar Gomita,
</p>
<p>
He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,<br>
    Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,<br>
    And dealt so with them each exults thereat;
</p>
<p>
Money he took, and let them smoothly off,<br>
    As he says; and in other offices<br>
    A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.
</p>
<p>
Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche<br>
    Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia<br>
    To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.
</p>
<p>
O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;<br>
    Still farther would I speak, but am afraid<br>
    Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.”
</p>
<p>
And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,<br>
    Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,<br>
    Said: “Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.”
</p>
<p>
“If you desire either to see or hear,”<br>
    The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,<br>
    “Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.
</p>
<p>
But let the Malebranche cease a little,<br>
    So that these may not their revenges fear,<br>
    And I, down sitting in this very place,
</p>
<p>
For one that I am will make seven come,<br>
    When I shall whistle, as our custom is<br>
    To do whenever one of us comes out.”
</p>
<p>
Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,<br>
    Shaking his head, and said: “Just hear the trick<br>
    Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!”
</p>
<p>
Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,<br>
    Responded: “I by far too cunning am,<br>
    When I procure for mine a greater sadness.”
</p>
<p>
Alichin held not in, but running counter<br>
    Unto the rest, said to him: “If thou dive,<br>
    I will not follow thee upon the gallop,
</p>
<p>
But I will beat my wings above the pitch;<br>
    The height be left, and be the bank a shield<br>
    To see if thou alone dost countervail us.”
</p>
<p>
O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!<br>
    Each to the other side his eyes averted;<br>
    He first, who most reluctant was to do it.
</p>
<p>
The Navarrese selected well his time;<br>
    Planted his feet on land, and in a moment<br>
    Leaped, and released himself from their design.
</p>
<p>
Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,<br>
    But he most who was cause of the defeat;<br>
    Therefore he moved, and cried: “Thou art o’ertakern.”
</p>
<p>
But little it availed, for wings could not<br>
    Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,<br>
    And, flying, upward he his breast directed;
</p>
<p>
Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden<br>
    Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,<br>
    And upward he returneth cross and weary.
</p>
<p>
Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina<br>
    Flying behind him followed close, desirous<br>
    The other should escape, to have a quarrel.
</p>
<p>
And when the barrator had disappeared,<br>
    He turned his talons upon his companion,<br>
    And grappled with him right above the moat.
</p>
<p>
But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk<br>
    To clapperclaw him well; and both of them<br>
    Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.
</p>
<p>
A sudden intercessor was the heat;<br>
    But ne’ertheless of rising there was naught,<br>
    To such degree they had their wings belimed.
</p>
<p>
Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia<br>
    Made four of them fly to the other side<br>
    With all their gaffs, and very speedily
</p>
<p>
This side and that they to their posts descended;<br>
    They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,<br>
    Who were already baked within the crust,
</p>
<p>
And in this manner busied did we leave them.

    We went, the one in front, the other after,<br>
    As go the Minor Friars along their way.
</p>
<p>
Upon the fable of Aesop was directed<br>
    My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,<br>
    Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;
</p>
<p>
For ‘mo’ and ‘issa’ are not more alike<br>
    Than this one is to that, if well we couple<br>
    End and beginning with a steadfast mind.
</p>
<p>
And even as one thought from another springs,<br>
    So afterward from that was born another,<br>
    Which the first fear within me double made.
</p>
<p>
Thus did I ponder: “These on our account<br>
    Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff<br>
    So great, that much I think it must annoy them.
</p>
<p>
If anger be engrafted on ill-will,<br>
    They will come after us more merciless<br>
    Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,”
</p>
<p>
I felt my hair stand all on end already<br>
    With terror, and stood backwardly intent,<br>
    When said I: “Master, if thou hidest not
</p>
<p>
Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche<br>
    I am in dread; we have them now behind us;<br>
    I so imagine them, I already feel them.”
</p>
<p>
And he: “If I were made of leaded glass,<br>
    Thine outward image I should not attract<br>
    Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.
</p>
<p>
Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,<br>
    With similar attitude and similar face,<br>
    So that of both one counsel sole I made.
</p>
<p>
If peradventure the right bank so slope<br>
    That we to the next Bolgia can descend,<br>
    We shall escape from the imagined chase.”
</p>
<p>
Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,<br>
    When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,<br>
    Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.
</p>
<p>
My Leader on a sudden seized me up,<br>
    Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,<br>
    And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,
</p>
<p>
Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,<br>
    Having more care of him than of herself,<br>
    So that she clothes her only with a shift;
</p>
<p>
And downward from the top of the hard bank<br>
    Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,<br>
    That one side of the other Bolgia walls.
</p>
<p>
Ne’er ran so swiftly water through a sluice<br>
    To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,<br>
    When nearest to the paddles it approaches,
</p>
<p>
As did my Master down along that border,<br>
    Bearing me with him on his breast away,<br>
    As his own son, and not as a companion.
</p>
<p>
Hardly the bed of the ravine below<br>
    His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill<br>
    Right over us; but he was not afraid;
</p>
<p>
For the high Providence, which had ordained<br>
    To place them ministers of the fifth moat,<br>
    The power of thence departing took from all.
</p>
<p>
A painted people there below we found,<br>
    Who went about with footsteps very slow,<br>
    Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.
</p>
<p>
They had on mantles with the hoods low down<br>
    Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut<br>
    That in Cologne they for the monks are made.
</p>
<p>
Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;<br>
    But inwardly all leaden and so heavy<br>
    That Frederick used to put them on of straw.
</p>
<p>
O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!<br>
    Again we turned us, still to the left hand<br>
    Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;
</p>
<p>
But owing to the weight, that weary folk<br>
    Came on so tardily, that we were new<br>
    In company at each motion of the haunch.
</p>
<p>
Whence I unto my Leader: “See thou find<br>
    Some one who may by deed or name be known,<br>
    And thus in going move thine eye about.”
</p>
<p>
And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,<br>
    Cried to us from behind: “Stay ye your feet,<br>
    Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!
</p>
<p>
Perhaps thou’lt have from me what thou demandest.”<br>
    Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: “Wait,<br>
    And then according to his pace proceed.”
</p>
<p>
I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste<br>
    Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;<br>
    But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.
</p>
<p>
When they came up, long with an eye askance<br>
    They scanned me without uttering a word.<br>
    Then to each other turned, and said together:
</p>
<p>
“He by the action of his throat seems living;<br>
    And if they dead are, by what privilege<br>
    Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?”
</p>
<p>
Then said to me: “Tuscan, who to the college<br>
    Of miserable hypocrites art come,<br>
    Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.”
</p>
<p>
And I to them: “Born was I, and grew up<br>
    In the great town on the fair river of Arno,<br>
    And with the body am I’ve always had.
</p>
<p>
But who are ye, in whom there trickles down<br>
    Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?<br>
    And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?”
</p>
<p>
And one replied to me: “These orange cloaks<br>
    Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights<br>
    Cause in this way their balances to creak.
</p>
<p>
Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;<br>
    I Catalano, and he Loderingo<br>
    Named, and together taken by thy city,
</p>
<p>
As the wont is to take one man alone,<br>
    For maintenance of its peace; and we were such<br>
    That still it is apparent round Gardingo.”
</p>
<p>
“O Friars,” began I, “your iniquitous. . .”<br>
    But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed<br>
    One crucified with three stakes on the ground.
</p>
<p>
When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,<br>
    Blowing into his beard with suspirations;<br>
    And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,
</p>
<p>
Said to me: “This transfixed one, whom thou seest,<br>
    Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet<br>
    To put one man to torture for the people.
</p>
<p>
Crosswise and naked is he on the path,<br>
    As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,<br>
    Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;
</p>
<p>
And in like mode his father-in-law is punished<br>
    Within this moat, and the others of the council,<br>
    Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.”
</p>
<p>
And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel<br>
    O’er him who was extended on the cross<br>
    So vilely in eternal banishment.
</p>
<p>
Then he directed to the Friar this voice:<br>
    “Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us<br>
    If to the right hand any pass slope down
</p>
<p>
By which we two may issue forth from here,<br>
    Without constraining some of the black angels<br>
    To come and extricate us from this deep.”
</p>
<p>
Then he made answer: “Nearer than thou hopest<br>
    There is a rock, that forth from the great circle<br>
    Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,
</p>
<p>
Save that at this ’tis broken, and does not bridge it;<br>
    You will be able to mount up the ruin,<br>
    That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.”
</p>
<p>
The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;<br>
    Then said: “The business badly he recounted<br>
    Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.”
</p>
<p>
And the Friar: “Many of the Devil’s vices<br>
    Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,<br>
    That he’s a liar and the father of lies.”
</p>
<p>
Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,<br>
    Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;<br>
    Whence from the heavy-laden I departed
</p>
<p>
After the prints of his beloved feet.
</p>
</div>

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXIV">
<p>
In that part of the youthful year wherein<br>
    The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,<br>
    And now the nights draw near to half the day,
</p>
<p>
What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground<br>
    The outward semblance of her sister white,<br>
    But little lasts the temper of her pen,
</p>
<p>
The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,<br>
    Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign<br>
    All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,
</p>
<p>
Returns in doors, and up and down laments,<br>
    Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;<br>
    Then he returns and hope revives again,
</p>
<p>
Seeing the world has changed its countenance<br>
    In little time, and takes his shepherd’s crook,<br>
    And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.
</p>
<p>
Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,<br>
    When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,<br>
    And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.
</p>
<p>
For as we came unto the ruined bridge,<br>
    The Leader turned to me with that sweet look<br>
    Which at the mountain’s foot I first beheld.
</p>
<p>
His arms he opened, after some advisement<br>
    Within himself elected, looking first<br>
    Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.
</p>
<p>
And even as he who acts and meditates,<br>
    For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,<br>
    So upward lifting me towards the summit
</p>
<p>
Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,<br>
    Saying: “To that one grapple afterwards,<br>
    But try first if ’tis such that it will hold thee.”
</p>
<p>
This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;<br>
    For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,<br>
    Were able to ascend from jag to jag.
</p>
<p>
And had it not been, that upon that precinct<br>
    Shorter was the ascent than on the other,<br>
    He I know not, but I had been dead beat.
</p>
<p>
But because Malebolge tow’rds the mouth<br>
    Of the profoundest well is all inclining,<br>
    The structure of each valley doth import
</p>
<p>
That one bank rises and the other sinks.<br>
    Still we arrived at length upon the point<br>
    Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.
</p>
<p>
The breath was from my lungs so milked away,<br>
    When I was up, that I could go no farther,<br>
    Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.
</p>
<p>
“Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,”<br>
    My Master said; “for sitting upon down,<br>
    Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,
</p>
<p>
Withouten which whoso his life consumes<br>
    Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,<br>
    As smoke in air or in the water foam.
</p>
<p>
And therefore raise thee up, o’ercome the anguish<br>
    With spirit that o’ercometh every battle,<br>
    If with its heavy body it sink not.
</p>
<p>
A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;<br>
    ’Tis not enough from these to have departed;<br>
    Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.”
</p>
<p>
Then I uprose, showing myself provided<br>
    Better with breath than I did feel myself,<br>
    And said: “Go on, for I am strong and bold.”
</p>
<p>
Upward we took our way along the crag,<br>
    Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,<br>
    And more precipitous far than that before.
</p>
<p>
Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;<br>
    Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,<br>
    Not well adapted to articulate words.
</p>
<p>
I know not what it said, though o’er the back<br>
    I now was of the arch that passes there;<br>
    But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.
</p>
<p>
I was bent downward, but my living eyes<br>
    Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;<br>
    Wherefore I: “Master, see that thou arrive
</p>
<p>
At the next round, and let us descend the wall;<br>
    For as from hence I hear and understand not,<br>
    So I look down and nothing I distinguish.”
</p>
<p>
“Other response,” he said, “I make thee not,<br>
    Except the doing; for the modest asking<br>
    Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.”
</p>
<p>
We from the bridge descended at its head,<br>
    Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,<br>
    And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;
</p>
<p>
And I beheld therein a terrible throng<br>
    Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,<br>
    That the remembrance still congeals my blood
</p>
<p>
Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;<br>
    For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae<br>
    She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,
</p>
<p>
Neither so many plagues nor so malignant<br>
    E’er showed she with all Ethiopia,<br>
    Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!
</p>
<p>
Among this cruel and most dismal throng<br>
    People were running naked and affrighted.<br>
    Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.
</p>
<p>
They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;<br>
    These riveted upon their reins the tail<br>
    And head, and were in front of them entwined.
</p>
<p>
And lo! at one who was upon our side<br>
    There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him<br>
    There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Nor ‘O’ so quickly e’er, nor ‘I’ was written,<br>
    As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly<br>
    Behoved it that in falling he became.
</p>
<p>
And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,<br>
    The ashes drew together, and of themselves<br>
    Into himself they instantly returned.
</p>
<p>
Even thus by the great sages ’tis confessed<br>
    The phoenix dies, and then is born again,<br>
    When it approaches its five-hundredth year;
</p>
<p>
On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,<br>
    But only on tears of incense and amomum,<br>
    And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.
</p>
<p>
And as he is who falls, and knows not how,<br>
    By force of demons who to earth down drag him,<br>
    Or other oppilation that binds man,
</p>
<p>
When he arises and around him looks,<br>
    Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish<br>
    Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;
</p>
<p>
Such was that sinner after he had risen.<br>
    Justice of God! O how severe it is,<br>
    That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!
</p>
<p>
The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;<br>
    Whence he replied: “I rained from Tuscany<br>
    A short time since into this cruel gorge.
</p>
<p>
A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,<br>
    Even as the mule I was; I’m Vanni Fucci,<br>
    Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.”
</p>
<p>
And I unto the Guide: “Tell him to stir not,<br>
    And ask what crime has thrust him here below,<br>
    For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.”
</p>
<p>
And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,<br>
    But unto me directed mind and face,<br>
    And with a melancholy shame was painted.
</p>
<p>
Then said: “It pains me more that thou hast caught me<br>
    Amid this misery where thou seest me,<br>
    Than when I from the other life was taken.
</p>
<p>
What thou demandest I cannot deny;<br>
    So low am I put down because I robbed<br>
    The sacristy of the fair ornaments,
</p>
<p>
And falsely once ’twas laid upon another;<br>
    But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,<br>
    If thou shalt e’er be out of the dark places,
</p>
<p>
Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:<br>
    Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;<br>
    Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;
</p>
<p>
Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,<br>
    Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,<br>
    And with impetuous and bitter tempest
</p>
<p>
Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;<br>
    When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,<br>
    So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.
</p>
<p>
And this I’ve said that it may give thee pain.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXV">
<p>
At the conclusion of his words, the thief<br>
    Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,<br>
    Crying: “Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.”
</p>
<p>
From that time forth the serpents were my friends;<br>
    For one entwined itself about his neck<br>
    As if it said: “I will not thou speak more;”
</p>
<p>
And round his arms another, and rebound him,<br>
    Clinching itself together so in front,<br>
    That with them he could not a motion make.
</p>
<p>
Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not<br>
    To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,<br>
    Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?
</p>
<p>
Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,<br>
    Spirit I saw not against God so proud,<br>
    Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!
</p>
<p>
He fled away, and spake no further word;<br>
    And I beheld a Centaur full of rage<br>
    Come crying out: “Where is, where is the scoffer?”
</p>
<p>
I do not think Maremma has so many<br>
    Serpents as he had all along his back,<br>
    As far as where our countenance begins.
</p>
<p>
Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,<br>
    With wings wide open was a dragon lying,<br>
    And he sets fire to all that he encounters.
</p>
<p>
My Master said: “That one is Cacus, who<br>
    Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine<br>
    Created oftentimes a lake of blood.
</p>
<p>
He goes not on the same road with his brothers,<br>
    By reason of the fraudulent theft he made<br>
    Of the great herd, which he had near to him;
</p>
<p>
Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath<br>
    The mace of Hercules, who peradventure<br>
    Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.”
</p>
<p>
While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,<br>
    And spirits three had underneath us come,<br>
    Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,
</p>
<p>
Until what time they shouted: “Who are you?”<br>
    On which account our story made a halt,<br>
    And then we were intent on them alone.
</p>
<p>
I did not know them; but it came to pass,<br>
    As it is wont to happen by some chance,<br>
    That one to name the other was compelled,
</p>
<p>
Exclaiming: “Where can Cianfa have remained?”<br>
    Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,<br>
    Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.
</p>
<p>
If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe<br>
    What I shall say, it will no marvel be,<br>
    For I who saw it hardly can admit it.
</p>
<p>
As I was holding raised on them my brows,<br>
    Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth<br>
    In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.
</p>
<p>
With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,<br>
    And with the forward ones his arms it seized;<br>
    Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;
</p>
<p>
The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,<br>
    And put its tail through in between the two,<br>
    And up behind along the reins outspread it.
</p>
<p>
Ivy was never fastened by its barbs<br>
    Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile<br>
    Upon the other’s limbs entwined its own.
</p>
<p>
Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax<br>
    They had been made, and intermixed their colour;<br>
    Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;
</p>
<p>
E’en as proceedeth on before the flame<br>
    Upward along the paper a brown colour,<br>
    Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.
</p>
<p>
The other two looked on, and each of them<br>
    Cried out: “O me, Agnello, how thou changest!<br>
    Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.”
</p>
<p>
Already the two heads had one become,<br>
    When there appeared to us two figures mingled<br>
    Into one face, wherein the two were lost.
</p>
<p>
Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,<br>
    The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest<br>
    Members became that never yet were seen.
</p>
<p>
Every original aspect there was cancelled;<br>
    Two and yet none did the perverted image<br>
    Appear, and such departed with slow pace.
</p>
<p>
Even as a lizard, under the great scourge<br>
    Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,<br>
    Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;
</p>
<p>
Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies<br>
    Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,<br>
    Livid and black as is a peppercorn.
</p>
<p>
And in that part whereat is first received<br>
    Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;<br>
    Then downward fell in front of him extended.
</p>
<p>
The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;<br>
    Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,<br>
    Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.
</p>
<p>
He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;<br>
    One through the wound, the other through the mouth<br>
    Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.
</p>
<p>
Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions<br>
    Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,<br>
    And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.
</p>
<p>
Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;<br>
    For if him to a snake, her to fountain,<br>
    Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;
</p>
<p>
Because two natures never front to front<br>
    Has he transmuted, so that both the forms<br>
    To interchange their matter ready were.
</p>
<p>
Together they responded in such wise,<br>
    That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,<br>
    And eke the wounded drew his feet together.
</p>
<p>
The legs together with the thighs themselves<br>
    Adhered so, that in little time the juncture<br>
    No sign whatever made that was apparent.
</p>
<p>
He with the cloven tail assumed the figure<br>
    The other one was losing, and his skin<br>
    Became elastic, and the other’s hard.
</p>
<p>
I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,<br>
    And both feet of the reptile, that were short,<br>
    Lengthen as much as those contracted were.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,<br>
    Became the member that a man conceals,<br>
    And of his own the wretch had two created.
</p>
<p>
While both of them the exhalation veils<br>
    With a new colour, and engenders hair<br>
    On one of them and depilates the other,
</p>
<p>
The one uprose and down the other fell,<br>
    Though turning not away their impious lamps,<br>
    Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.
</p>
<p>
He who was standing drew it tow’rds the temples,<br>
    And from excess of matter, which came thither,<br>
    Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;
</p>
<p>
What did not backward run and was retained<br>
    Of that excess made to the face a nose,<br>
    And the lips thickened far as was befitting.
</p>
<p>
He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,<br>
    And backward draws the ears into his head,<br>
    In the same manner as the snail its horns;
</p>
<p>
And so the tongue, which was entire and apt<br>
    For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked<br>
    In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.
</p>
<p>
The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,<br>
    Along the valley hissing takes to flight,<br>
    And after him the other speaking sputters.
</p>
<p>
Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,<br>
    And said to the other: “I’ll have Buoso run,<br>
    Crawling as I have done, along this road.”
</p>
<p>
In this way I beheld the seventh ballast<br>
    Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse<br>
    The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.
</p>
<p>
And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be<br>
    Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,<br>
    They could not flee away so secretly
</p>
<p>
But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;<br>
    And he it was who sole of three companions,<br>
    Which came in the beginning, was not changed;
</p>
<p>
The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXVI">
<p>
Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,<br>
    That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,<br>
    And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!
</p>
<p>
Among the thieves five citizens of thine<br>
    Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,<br>
    And thou thereby to no great honour risest.
</p>
<p>
But if when morn is near our dreams are true,<br>
    Feel shalt thou in a little time from now<br>
    What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.
</p>
<p>
And if it now were, it were not too soon;<br>
    Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,<br>
    For ’twill aggrieve me more the more I age.
</p>
<p>
We went our way, and up along the stairs<br>
    The bourns had made us to descend before,<br>
    Remounted my Conductor and drew me.
</p>
<p>
And following the solitary path<br>
    Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,<br>
    The foot without the hand sped not at all.
</p>
<p>
Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,<br>
    When I direct my mind to what I saw,<br>
    And more my genius curb than I am wont,
</p>
<p>
That it may run not unless virtue guide it;<br>
    So that if some good star, or better thing,<br>
    Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.
</p>
<p>
As many as the hind (who on the hill<br>
    Rests at the time when he who lights the world<br>
    His countenance keeps least concealed from us,
</p>
<p>
While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)<br>
    Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,<br>
    Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;
</p>
<p>
With flames as manifold resplendent all<br>
    Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware<br>
    As soon as I was where the depth appeared.
</p>
<p>
And such as he who with the bears avenged him<br>
    Beheld Elijah’s chariot at departing,<br>
    What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,
</p>
<p>
For with his eye he could not follow it<br>
    So as to see aught else than flame alone,<br>
    Even as a little cloud ascending upward,
</p>
<p>
Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment<br>
    Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,<br>
    And every flame a sinner steals away.
</p>
<p>
I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,<br>
    So that, if I had seized not on a rock,<br>
    Down had I fallen without being pushed.
</p>
<p>
And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,<br>
    Exclaimed: “Within the fires the spirits are;<br>
    Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.”
</p>
<p>
“My Master,” I replied, “by hearing thee<br>
    I am more sure; but I surmised already<br>
    It might be so, and already wished to ask thee
</p>
<p>
Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft<br>
    At top, it seems uprising from the pyre<br>
    Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.”
</p>
<p>
He answered me: “Within there are tormented<br>
    Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together<br>
    They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.
</p>
<p>
And there within their flame do they lament<br>
    The ambush of the horse, which made the door<br>
    Whence issued forth the Romans’ gentle seed;
</p>
<p>
Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead<br>
    Deidamia still deplores Achilles,<br>
    And pain for the Palladium there is borne.”
</p>
<p>
“If they within those sparks possess the power<br>
    To speak,” I said, “thee, Master, much I pray,<br>
    And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,
</p>
<p>
That thou make no denial of awaiting<br>
    Until the horned flame shall hither come;<br>
    Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Worthy is thy entreaty<br>
    Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;<br>
    But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.
</p>
<p>
Leave me to speak, because I have conceived<br>
    That which thou wishest; for they might disdain<br>
    Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.”
</p>
<p>
When now the flame had come unto that point,<br>
    Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,<br>
    After this fashion did I hear him speak:
</p>
<p>
“O ye, who are twofold within one fire,<br>
    If I deserved of you, while I was living,<br>
    If I deserved of you or much or little
</p>
<p>
When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,<br>
    Do not move on, but one of you declare<br>
    Whither, being lost, he went away to die.”
</p>
<p>
Then of the antique flame the greater horn,<br>
    Murmuring, began to wave itself about<br>
    Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.
</p>
<p>
Thereafterward, the summit to and fro<br>
    Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,<br>
    It uttered forth a voice, and said: “When I
</p>
<p>
From Circe had departed, who concealed me<br>
    More than a year there near unto Gaeta,<br>
    Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,
</p>
<p>
Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br>
    For my old father, nor the due affection<br>
    Which joyous should have made Penelope,
</p>
<p>
Could overcome within me the desire<br>
    I had to be experienced of the world,<br>
    And of the vice and virtue of mankind;
</p>
<p>
But I put forth on the high open sea<br>
    With one sole ship, and that small company<br>
    By which I never had deserted been.
</p>
<p>
Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,<br>
    Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,<br>
    And the others which that sea bathes round about.
</p>
<p>
I and my company were old and slow<br>
    When at that narrow passage we arrived<br>
    Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,
</p>
<p>
That man no farther onward should adventure.<br>
    On the right hand behind me left I Seville,<br>
    And on the other already had left Ceuta.
</p>
<p>
‘O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand<br>
    Perils,’ I said, ‘have come unto the West,<br>
    To this so inconsiderable vigil
</p>
<p>
Which is remaining of your senses still<br>
    Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,<br>
    Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.
</p>
<p>
Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;<br>
    Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,<br>
    But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.’
</p>
<p>
So eager did I render my companions,<br>
    With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,<br>
    That then I hardly could have held them back.
</p>
<p>
And having turned our stern unto the morning,<br>
    We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,<br>
    Evermore gaining on the larboard side.
</p>
<p>
Already all the stars of the other pole<br>
    The night beheld, and ours so very low<br>
    It did not rise above the ocean floor.
</p>
<p>
Five times rekindled and as many quenched<br>
    Had been the splendour underneath the moon,<br>
    Since we had entered into the deep pass,
</p>
<p>
When there appeared to us a mountain, dim<br>
    From distance, and it seemed to me so high<br>
    As I had never any one beheld.
</p>
<p>
Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;<br>
    For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,<br>
    And smote upon the fore part of the ship.
</p>
<p>
Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,<br>
    At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,<br>
    And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,
</p>
<p>
Until the sea above us closed again.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXVII">
<p>
Already was the flame erect and quiet,<br>
    To speak no more, and now departed from us<br>
    With the permission of the gentle Poet;
</p>
<p>
When yet another, which behind it came,<br>
    Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top<br>
    By a confused sound that issued from it.
</p>
<p>
As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first<br>
    With the lament of him, and that was right,<br>
    Who with his file had modulated it)
</p>
<p>
Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,<br>
    That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,<br>
    Still it appeared with agony transfixed;
</p>
<p>
Thus, by not having any way or issue<br>
    At first from out the fire, to its own language<br>
    Converted were the melancholy words.
</p>
<p>
But afterwards, when they had gathered way<br>
    Up through the point, giving it that vibration<br>
    The tongue had given them in their passage out,
</p>
<p>
We heard it said: “O thou, at whom I aim<br>
    My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,<br>
    Saying, ‘Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,’
</p>
<p>
Because I come perchance a little late,<br>
    To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;<br>
    Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.
</p>
<p>
If thou but lately into this blind world<br>
    Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,<br>
    Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,
</p>
<p>
Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,<br>
    For I was from the mountains there between<br>
    Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.”
</p>
<p>
I still was downward bent and listening,<br>
    When my Conductor touched me on the side,<br>
    Saying: “Speak thou: this one a Latian is.”
</p>
<p>
And I, who had beforehand my reply<br>
    In readiness, forthwith began to speak:<br>
    “O soul, that down below there art concealed,
</p>
<p>
Romagna thine is not and never has been<br>
    Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;<br>
    But open war I none have left there now.
</p>
<p>
Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;<br>
    The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,<br>
    So that she covers Cervia with her vans.
</p>
<p>
The city which once made the long resistance,<br>
    And of the French a sanguinary heap,<br>
    Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;
</p>
<p>
Verrucchio’s ancient Mastiff and the new,<br>
    Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,<br>
    Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.
</p>
<p>
The cities of Lamone and Santerno<br>
    Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,<br>
    Who changes sides ’twixt summer-time and winter;
</p>
<p>
And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,<br>
    Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,<br>
    Lives between tyranny and a free state.
</p>
<p>
Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;<br>
    Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,<br>
    So may thy name hold front there in the world.”
</p>
<p>
After the fire a little more had roared<br>
    In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved<br>
    This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:
</p>
<p>
“If I believed that my reply were made<br>
    To one who to the world would e’er return,<br>
    This flame without more flickering would stand still;
</p>
<p>
But inasmuch as never from this depth<br>
    Did any one return, if I hear true,<br>
    Without the fear of infamy I answer,
</p>
<p>
I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,<br>
    Believing thus begirt to make amends;<br>
    And truly my belief had been fulfilled
</p>
<p>
But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,<br>
    Who put me back into my former sins;<br>
    And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.
</p>
<p>
While I was still the form of bone and pulp<br>
    My mother gave to me, the deeds I did<br>
    Were not those of a lion, but a fox.
</p>
<p>
The machinations and the covert ways<br>
    I knew them all, and practised so their craft,<br>
    That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.
</p>
<p>
When now unto that portion of mine age<br>
    I saw myself arrived, when each one ought<br>
    To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,
</p>
<p>
That which before had pleased me then displeased me;<br>
    And penitent and confessing I surrendered,<br>
    Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;
</p>
<p>
The Leader of the modern Pharisees<br>
    Having a war near unto Lateran,<br>
    And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
</p>
<p>
For each one of his enemies was Christian,<br>
    And none of them had been to conquer Acre,<br>
    Nor merchandising in the Sultan’s land,
</p>
<p>
Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,<br>
    In him regarded, nor in me that cord<br>
    Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;
</p>
<p>
But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester<br>
    To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,<br>
    So this one sought me out as an adept
</p>
<p>
To cure him of the fever of his pride.<br>
    Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,<br>
    Because his words appeared inebriate.
</p>
<p>
And then he said: ‘Be not thy heart afraid;<br>
    Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me<br>
    How to raze Palestrina to the ground.
</p>
<p>
Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,<br>
    As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,<br>
    The which my predecessor held not dear.’
</p>
<p>
Then urged me on his weighty arguments<br>
    There, where my silence was the worst advice;<br>
    And said I: ‘Father, since thou washest me
</p>
<p>
Of that sin into which I now must fall,<br>
    The promise long with the fulfilment short<br>
    Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.’
</p>
<p>
Francis came afterward, when I was dead,<br>
    For me; but one of the black Cherubim<br>
    Said to him: ‘Take him not; do me no wrong;
</p>
<p>
He must come down among my servitors,<br>
    Because he gave the fraudulent advice<br>
    From which time forth I have been at his hair;
</p>
<p>
For who repents not cannot be absolved,<br>
    Nor can one both repent and will at once,<br>
    Because of the contradiction which consents not.’
</p>
<p>
O miserable me! how I did shudder<br>
    When he seized on me, saying: ‘Peradventure<br>
    Thou didst not think that I was a logician!’
</p>
<p>
He bore me unto Minos, who entwined<br>
    Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,<br>
    And after he had bitten it in great rage,
</p>
<p>
Said: ‘Of the thievish fire a culprit this;’<br>
    Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,<br>
    And vested thus in going I bemoan me.”
</p>
<p>
When it had thus completed its recital,<br>
    The flame departed uttering lamentations,<br>
    Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.
</p>
<p>
Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,<br>
    Up o’er the crag above another arch,<br>
    Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee
</p>
<p>
By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.
</p>
</div>

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXVIII">
<p>
Who ever could, e’en with untrammelled words,<br>
    Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full<br>
    Which now I saw, by many times narrating?
</p>
<p>
Each tongue would for a certainty fall short<br>
    By reason of our speech and memory,<br>
    That have small room to comprehend so much.
</p>
<p>
If were again assembled all the people<br>
    Which formerly upon the fateful land<br>
    Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood
</p>
<p>
Shed by the Romans and the lingering war<br>
    That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,<br>
    As Livy has recorded, who errs not,
</p>
<p>
With those who felt the agony of blows<br>
    By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,<br>
    And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still
</p>
<p>
At Ceperano, where a renegade<br>
    Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,<br>
    Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,
</p>
<p>
And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,<br>
    Should show, it would be nothing to compare<br>
    With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.
</p>
<p>
A cask by losing centre-piece or cant<br>
    Was never shattered so, as I saw one<br>
    Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.
</p>
<p>
Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;<br>
    His heart was visible, and the dismal sack<br>
    That maketh excrement of what is eaten.
</p>
<p>
While I was all absorbed in seeing him,<br>
    He looked at me, and opened with his hands<br>
    His bosom, saying: “See now how I rend me;
</p>
<p>
How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;<br>
    In front of me doth Ali weeping go,<br>
    Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;
</p>
<p>
And all the others whom thou here beholdest,<br>
    Disseminators of scandal and of schism<br>
    While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.
</p>
<p>
A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us<br>
    Thus cruelly, unto the falchion’s edge<br>
    Putting again each one of all this ream,
</p>
<p>
When we have gone around the doleful road;<br>
    By reason that our wounds are closed again<br>
    Ere any one in front of him repass.
</p>
<p>
But who art thou, that musest on the crag,<br>
    Perchance to postpone going to the pain<br>
    That is adjudged upon thine accusations?”
</p>
<p>
“Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,”<br>
    My Master made reply, “to be tormented;<br>
    But to procure him full experience,
</p>
<p>
Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him<br>
    Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;<br>
    And this is true as that I speak to thee.”
</p>
<p>
More than a hundred were there when they heard him,<br>
    Who in the moat stood still to look at me,<br>
    Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.
</p>
<p>
“Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,<br>
    Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,<br>
    If soon he wish not here to follow me,
</p>
<p>
So with provisions, that no stress of snow<br>
    May give the victory to the Novarese,<br>
    Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.”
</p>
<p>
After one foot to go away he lifted,<br>
    This word did Mahomet say unto me,<br>
    Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.
</p>
<p>
Another one, who had his throat pierced through,<br>
    And nose cut off close underneath the brows,<br>
    And had no longer but a single ear,
</p>
<p>
Staying to look in wonder with the others,<br>
    Before the others did his gullet open,<br>
    Which outwardly was red in every part,
</p>
<p>
And said: “O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,<br>
    And whom I once saw up in Latian land,<br>
    Unless too great similitude deceive me,
</p>
<p>
Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,<br>
    If e’er thou see again the lovely plain<br>
    That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,
</p>
<p>
And make it known to the best two of Fano,<br>
    To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,<br>
    That if foreseeing here be not in vain,
</p>
<p>
Cast over from their vessel shall they be,<br>
    And drowned near unto the Cattolica,<br>
    By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.
</p>
<p>
Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca<br>
    Neptune ne’er yet beheld so great a crime,<br>
    Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.
</p>
<p>
That traitor, who sees only with one eye,<br>
    And holds the land, which some one here with me<br>
    Would fain be fasting from the vision of,
</p>
<p>
Will make them come unto a parley with him;<br>
    Then will do so, that to Focara’s wind<br>
    They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “Show to me and declare,<br>
    If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,<br>
    Who is this person of the bitter vision.”
</p>
<p>
Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw<br>
    Of one of his companions, and his mouth<br>
    Oped, crying: “This is he, and he speaks not.
</p>
<p>
This one, being banished, every doubt submerged<br>
    In Caesar by affirming the forearmed<br>
    Always with detriment allowed delay.”
</p>
<p>
O how bewildered unto me appeared,<br>
    With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,<br>
    Curio, who in speaking was so bold!
</p>
<p>
And one, who both his hands dissevered had,<br>
    The stumps uplifting through the murky air,<br>
    So that the blood made horrible his face,
</p>
<p>
Cried out: “Thou shalt remember Mosca also,<br>
    Who said, alas! ‘A thing done has an end!’<br>
    Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.”
</p>
<p>
“And death unto thy race,” thereto I added;<br>
    Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,<br>
    Departed, like a person sad and crazed.
</p>
<p>
But I remained to look upon the crowd;<br>
    And saw a thing which I should be afraid,<br>
    Without some further proof, even to recount,
</p>
<p>
If it were not that conscience reassures me,<br>
    That good companion which emboldens man<br>
    Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.
</p>
<p>
I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,<br>
    A trunk without a head walk in like manner<br>
    As walked the others of the mournful herd.
</p>
<p>
And by the hair it held the head dissevered,<br>
    Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,<br>
    And that upon us gazed and said: “O me!”
</p>
<p>
It of itself made to itself a lamp,<br>
    And they were two in one, and one in two;<br>
    How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.
</p>
<p>
When it was come close to the bridge’s foot,<br>
    It lifted high its arm with all the head,<br>
    To bring more closely unto us its words,
</p>
<p>
Which were: “Behold now the sore penalty,<br>
    Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;<br>
    Behold if any be as great as this.
</p>
<p>
And so that thou may carry news of me,<br>
    Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same<br>
    Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.
</p>
<p>
I made the father and the son rebellious;<br>
    Achitophel not more with Absalom<br>
    And David did with his accursed goadings.
</p>
<p>
Because I parted persons so united,<br>
    Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!<br>
    From its beginning, which is in this trunk.
</p>
<p>
Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXIX">
<p>
The many people and the divers wounds<br>
    These eyes of mine had so inebriated,<br>
    That they were wishful to stand still and weep;
</p>
<p>
But said Virgilius: “What dost thou still gaze at?<br>
    Why is thy sight still riveted down there<br>
    Among the mournful, mutilated shades?
</p>
<p>
Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;<br>
    Consider, if to count them thou believest,<br>
    That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,
</p>
<p>
And now the moon is underneath our feet;<br>
    Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,<br>
    And more is to be seen than what thou seest.”
</p>
<p>
“If thou hadst,” I made answer thereupon,<br>
    “Attended to the cause for which I looked,<br>
    Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him<br>
    I went, already making my reply,<br>
    And superadding: “In that cavern where
</p>
<p>
I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,<br>
    I think a spirit of my blood laments<br>
    The sin which down below there costs so much.”
</p>
<p>
Then said the Master: “Be no longer broken<br>
    Thy thought from this time forward upon him;<br>
    Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;
</p>
<p>
For him I saw below the little bridge,<br>
    Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger<br>
    Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.
</p>
<p>
So wholly at that time wast thou impeded<br>
    By him who formerly held Altaforte,<br>
    Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.”
</p>
<p>
“O my Conductor, his own violent death,<br>
    Which is not yet avenged for him,” I said,<br>
    “By any who is sharer in the shame,
</p>
<p>
Made him disdainful; whence he went away,<br>
    As I imagine, without speaking to me,<br>
    And thereby made me pity him the more.”
</p>
<p>
Thus did we speak as far as the first place<br>
    Upon the crag, which the next valley shows<br>
    Down to the bottom, if there were more light.
</p>
<p>
When we were now right over the last cloister<br>
    Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers<br>
    Could manifest themselves unto our sight,
</p>
<p>
Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,<br>
    Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,<br>
    Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.
</p>
<p>
What pain would be, if from the hospitals<br>
    Of Valdichiana, ’twixt July and September,<br>
    And of Maremma and Sardinia
</p>
<p>
All the diseases in one moat were gathered,<br>
    Such was it here, and such a stench came from it<br>
    As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.
</p>
<p>
We had descended on the furthest bank<br>
    From the long crag, upon the left hand still,<br>
    And then more vivid was my power of sight
</p>
<p>
Down tow’rds the bottom, where the ministress<br>
    Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,<br>
    Punishes forgers, which she here records.
</p>
<p>
I do not think a sadder sight to see<br>
    Was in Aegina the whole people sick,<br>
    (When was the air so full of pestilence,
</p>
<p>
The animals, down to the little worm,<br>
    All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,<br>
    According as the poets have affirmed,
</p>
<p>
Were from the seed of ants restored again,)<br>
    Than was it to behold through that dark valley<br>
    The spirits languishing in divers heaps.
</p>
<p>
This on the belly, that upon the back<br>
    One of the other lay, and others crawling<br>
    Shifted themselves along the dismal road.
</p>
<p>
We step by step went onward without speech,<br>
    Gazing upon and listening to the sick<br>
    Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.
</p>
<p>
I saw two sitting leaned against each other,<br>
    As leans in heating platter against platter,<br>
    From head to foot bespotted o’er with scabs;
</p>
<p>
And never saw I plied a currycomb<br>
    By stable-boy for whom his master waits,<br>
    Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,
</p>
<p>
As every one was plying fast the bite<br>
    Of nails upon himself, for the great rage<br>
    Of itching which no other succour had.
</p>
<p>
And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,<br>
    In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,<br>
    Or any other fish that has them largest.
</p>
<p>
“O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,”<br>
    Began my Leader unto one of them,<br>
    “And makest of them pincers now and then,
</p>
<p>
Tell me if any Latian is with those<br>
    Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee<br>
    To all eternity unto this work.”
</p>
<p>
“Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,<br>
    Both of us here,” one weeping made reply;<br>
    “But who art thou, that questionest about us?”
</p>
<p>
And said the Guide: “One am I who descends<br>
    Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,<br>
    And I intend to show Hell unto him.”
</p>
<p>
Then broken was their mutual support,<br>
    And trembling each one turned himself to me,<br>
    With others who had heard him by rebound.
</p>
<p>
Wholly to me did the good Master gather,<br>
    Saying: “Say unto them whate’er thou wishest.”<br>
    And I began, since he would have it so:
</p>
<p>
“So may your memory not steal away<br>
    In the first world from out the minds of men,<br>
    But so may it survive ’neath many suns,
</p>
<p>
Say to me who ye are, and of what people;<br>
    Let not your foul and loathsome punishment<br>
    Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.”
</p>
<p>
“I of Arezzo was,” one made reply,<br>
    “And Albert of Siena had me burned;<br>
    But what I died for does not bring me here.
</p>
<p>
’Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,<br>
    That I could rise by flight into the air,<br>
    And he who had conceit, but little wit,
</p>
<p>
Would have me show to him the art; and only<br>
    Because no Daedalus I made him, made me<br>
    Be burned by one who held him as his son.
</p>
<p>
But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,<br>
    For alchemy, which in the world I practised,<br>
    Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.”
</p>
<p>
And to the Poet said I: “Now was ever<br>
    So vain a people as the Sienese?<br>
    Not for a certainty the French by far.”
</p>
<p>
Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,<br>
    Replied unto my speech: “Taking out Stricca,<br>
    Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
</p>
<p>
And Niccolo, who the luxurious use<br>
    Of cloves discovered earliest of all<br>
    Within that garden where such seed takes root;
</p>
<p>
And taking out the band, among whom squandered<br>
    Caccia d’Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,<br>
    And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!
</p>
<p>
But, that thou know who thus doth second thee<br>
    Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye<br>
    Tow’rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
</p>
<p>
And thou shalt see I am Capocchio’s shade,<br>
    Who metals falsified by alchemy;<br>
    Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,
</p>
<p>
How I a skilful ape of nature was.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXX">
<p>
’Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,<br>
    For Semele, against the Theban blood,<br>
    As she already more than once had shown,
</p>
<p>
So reft of reason Athamas became,<br>
    That, seeing his own wife with children twain<br>
    Walking encumbered upon either hand,
</p>
<p>
He cried: “Spread out the nets, that I may take<br>
    The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;”<br>
    And then extended his unpitying claws,
</p>
<p>
Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,<br>
    And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;<br>
    And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;—
</p>
<p>
And at the time when fortune downward hurled<br>
    The Trojan’s arrogance, that all things dared,<br>
    So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,
</p>
<p>
Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,<br>
    When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,<br>
    And of her Polydorus on the shore
</p>
<p>
Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,<br>
    Out of her senses like a dog she barked,<br>
    So much the anguish had her mind distorted;
</p>
<p>
But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan<br>
    Were ever seen in any one so cruel<br>
    In goading beasts, and much more human members,
</p>
<p>
As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,<br>
    Who, biting, in the manner ran along<br>
    That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.
</p>
<p>
One to Capocchio came, and by the nape<br>
    Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging<br>
    It made his belly grate the solid bottom.
</p>
<p>
And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,<br>
    Said to me: “That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,<br>
    And raving goes thus harrying other people.”
</p>
<p>
“O,” said I to him, “so may not the other<br>
    Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee<br>
    To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “That is the ancient ghost<br>
    Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became<br>
    Beyond all rightful love her father’s lover.
</p>
<p>
She came to sin with him after this manner,<br>
    By counterfeiting of another’s form;<br>
    As he who goeth yonder undertook,
</p>
<p>
That he might gain the lady of the herd,<br>
    To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,<br>
    Making a will and giving it due form.”
</p>
<p>
And after the two maniacs had passed<br>
    On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back<br>
    To look upon the other evil-born.
</p>
<p>
I saw one made in fashion of a lute,<br>
    If he had only had the groin cut off<br>
    Just at the point at which a man is forked.
</p>
<p>
The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions<br>
    The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,<br>
    That the face corresponds not to the belly,
</p>
<p>
Compelled him so to hold his lips apart<br>
    As does the hectic, who because of thirst<br>
    One tow’rds the chin, the other upward turns.
</p>
<p>
“O ye, who without any torment are,<br>
    And why I know not, in the world of woe,”<br>
    He said to us, “behold, and be attentive
</p>
<p>
Unto the misery of Master Adam;<br>
    I had while living much of what I wished,<br>
    And now, alas! a drop of water crave.
</p>
<p>
The rivulets, that from the verdant hills<br>
    Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,<br>
    Making their channels to be cold and moist,
</p>
<p>
Ever before me stand, and not in vain;<br>
    For far more doth their image dry me up<br>
    Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.
</p>
<p>
The rigid justice that chastises me<br>
    Draweth occasion from the place in which<br>
    I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.
</p>
<p>
There is Romena, where I counterfeited<br>
    The currency imprinted with the Baptist,<br>
    For which I left my body burned above.
</p>
<p>
But if I here could see the tristful soul<br>
    Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,<br>
    For Branda’s fount I would not give the sight.
</p>
<p>
One is within already, if the raving<br>
    Shades that are going round about speak truth;<br>
    But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?
</p>
<p>
If I were only still so light, that in<br>
    A hundred years I could advance one inch,<br>
    I had already started on the way,
</p>
<p>
Seeking him out among this squalid folk,<br>
    Although the circuit be eleven miles,<br>
    And be not less than half a mile across.
</p>
<p>
For them am I in such a family;<br>
    They did induce me into coining florins,<br>
    Which had three carats of impurity.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “Who are the two poor wretches<br>
    That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,<br>
    Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?”
</p>
<p>
“I found them here,” replied he, “when I rained<br>
    Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,<br>
    Nor do I think they will for evermore.
</p>
<p>
One the false woman is who accused Joseph,<br>
    The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;<br>
    From acute fever they send forth such reek.”
</p>
<p>
And one of them, who felt himself annoyed<br>
    At being, peradventure, named so darkly,<br>
    Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.
</p>
<p>
It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;<br>
    And Master Adam smote him in the face,<br>
    With arm that did not seem to be less hard,
</p>
<p>
Saying to him: “Although be taken from me<br>
    All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,<br>
    I have an arm unfettered for such need.”
</p>
<p>
Whereat he answer made: “When thou didst go<br>
    Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:<br>
    But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.”
</p>
<p>
The dropsical: “Thou sayest true in that;<br>
    But thou wast not so true a witness there,<br>
    Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.”
</p>
<p>
“If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,”<br>
    Said Sinon; “and for one fault I am here,<br>
    And thou for more than any other demon.”
</p>
<p>
“Remember, perjurer, about the horse,”<br>
    He made reply who had the swollen belly,<br>
    “And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.”
</p>
<p>
“Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks<br>
    Thy tongue,” the Greek said, “and the putrid water<br>
    That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.”
</p>
<p>
Then the false-coiner: “So is gaping wide<br>
    Thy mouth for speaking evil, as ’tis wont;<br>
    Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me
</p>
<p>
Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,<br>
    And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus<br>
    Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.”
</p>
<p>
In listening to them was I wholly fixed,<br>
    When said the Master to me: “Now just look,<br>
    For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.”
</p>
<p>
When him I heard in anger speak to me,<br>
    I turned me round towards him with such shame<br>
    That still it eddies through my memory.
</p>
<p>
And as he is who dreams of his own harm,<br>
    Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,<br>
    So that he craves what is, as if it were not;
</p>
<p>
Such I became, not having power to speak,<br>
    For to excuse myself I wished, and still<br>
    Excused myself, and did not think I did it.
</p>
<p>
“Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,”<br>
    The Master said, “than this of thine has been;<br>
    Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,
</p>
<p>
And make account that I am aye beside thee,<br>
    If e’er it come to pass that fortune bring thee<br>
    Where there are people in a like dispute;
</p>
<p>
For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXXI">
<p>
One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,<br>
    So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,<br>
    And then held out to me the medicine;
</p>
<p>
Thus do I hear that once Achilles’ spear,<br>
    His and his father’s, used to be the cause<br>
    First of a sad and then a gracious boon.
</p>
<p>
We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,<br>
    Upon the bank that girds it round about,<br>
    Going across it without any speech.
</p>
<p>
There it was less than night, and less than day,<br>
    So that my sight went little in advance;<br>
    But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,
</p>
<p>
So loud it would have made each thunder faint,<br>
    Which, counter to it following its way,<br>
    Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.
</p>
<p>
After the dolorous discomfiture<br>
    When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,<br>
    So terribly Orlando sounded not.
</p>
<p>
Short while my head turned thitherward I held<br>
    When many lofty towers I seemed to see,<br>
    Whereat I: “Master, say, what town is this?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Because thou peerest forth<br>
    Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,<br>
    It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.
</p>
<p>
Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,<br>
    How much the sense deceives itself by distance;<br>
    Therefore a little faster spur thee on.”
</p>
<p>
Then tenderly he took me by the hand,<br>
    And said: “Before we farther have advanced,<br>
    That the reality may seem to thee
</p>
<p>
Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,<br>
    And they are in the well, around the bank,<br>
    From navel downward, one and all of them.”
</p>
<p>
As, when the fog is vanishing away,<br>
    Little by little doth the sight refigure<br>
    Whate’er the mist that crowds the air conceals,
</p>
<p>
So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,<br>
    More and more near approaching tow’rd the verge,<br>
    My error fled, and fear came over me;
</p>
<p>
Because as on its circular parapets<br>
    Montereggione crowns itself with towers,<br>
    E’en thus the margin which surrounds the well
</p>
<p>
With one half of their bodies turreted<br>
    The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces<br>
    E’en now from out the heavens when he thunders.
</p>
<p>
And I of one already saw the face,<br>
    Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,<br>
    And down along his sides both of the arms.
</p>
<p>
Certainly Nature, when she left the making<br>
    Of animals like these, did well indeed,<br>
    By taking such executors from Mars;
</p>
<p>
And if of elephants and whales she doth not<br>
    Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly<br>
    More just and more discreet will hold her for it;
</p>
<p>
For where the argument of intellect<br>
    Is added unto evil will and power,<br>
    No rampart can the people make against it.
</p>
<p>
His face appeared to me as long and large<br>
    As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter’s,<br>
    And in proportion were the other bones;
</p>
<p>
So that the margin, which an apron was<br>
    Down from the middle, showed so much of him<br>
    Above it, that to reach up to his hair
</p>
<p>
Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;<br>
    For I beheld thirty great palms of him<br>
    Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.
</p>
<p>
“Raphael mai amech izabi almi,”<br>
    Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,<br>
    To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.
</p>
<p>
And unto him my Guide: “Soul idiotic,<br>
    Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,<br>
    When wrath or other passion touches thee.
</p>
<p>
Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt<br>
    Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,<br>
    And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.”
</p>
<p>
Then said to me: “He doth himself accuse;<br>
    This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought<br>
    One language in the world is not still used.
</p>
<p>
Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;<br>
    For even such to him is every language<br>
    As his to others, which to none is known.”
</p>
<p>
Therefore a longer journey did we make,<br>
    Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft<br>
    We found another far more fierce and large.
</p>
<p>
In binding him, who might the master be<br>
    I cannot say; but he had pinioned close<br>
    Behind the right arm, and in front the other,
</p>
<p>
With chains, that held him so begirt about<br>
    From the neck down, that on the part uncovered<br>
    It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.
</p>
<p>
“This proud one wished to make experiment<br>
    Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,”<br>
    My Leader said, “whence he has such a guerdon.
</p>
<p>
Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.<br>
    What time the giants terrified the gods;<br>
    The arms he wielded never more he moves.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “If possible, I should wish<br>
    That of the measureless Briareus<br>
    These eyes of mine might have experience.”
</p>
<p>
Whence he replied: “Thou shalt behold Antaeus<br>
    Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,<br>
    Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.
</p>
<p>
Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,<br>
    And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,<br>
    Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.”
</p>
<p>
There never was an earthquake of such might<br>
    That it could shake a tower so violently,<br>
    As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.
</p>
<p>
Then was I more afraid of death than ever,<br>
    For nothing more was needful than the fear,<br>
    If I had not beheld the manacles.
</p>
<p>
Then we proceeded farther in advance,<br>
    And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells<br>
    Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.
</p>
<p>
“O thou, who in the valley fortunate,<br>
    Which Scipio the heir of glory made,<br>
    When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,
</p>
<p>
Once brought’st a thousand lions for thy prey,<br>
    And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war<br>
    Among thy brothers, some it seems still think
</p>
<p>
The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:<br>
    Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,<br>
    There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.
</p>
<p>
Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;<br>
    This one can give of that which here is longed for;<br>
    Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.
</p>
<p>
Still in the world can he restore thy fame;<br>
    Because he lives, and still expects long life,<br>
    If to itself Grace call him not untimely.”
</p>
<p>
So said the Master; and in haste the other<br>
    His hands extended and took up my Guide,—<br>
    Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.
</p>
<p>
Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,<br>
    Said unto me: “Draw nigh, that I may take thee;”<br>
    Then of himself and me one bundle made.
</p>
<p>
As seems the Carisenda, to behold<br>
    Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud<br>
    Above it so that opposite it hangs;
</p>
<p>
Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood<br>
    Watching to see him stoop, and then it was<br>
    I could have wished to go some other way.
</p>
<p>
But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up<br>
    Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;<br>
    Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,
</p>
<p>
But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.

<p>
If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,<br>
    As were appropriate to the dismal hole<br>
    Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,
</p>
<p>
I would press out the juice of my conception<br>
    More fully; but because I have them not,<br>
    Not without fear I bring myself to speak;
</p>
<p>
For ’tis no enterprise to take in jest,<br>
    To sketch the bottom of all the universe,<br>
    Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.
</p>
<p>
But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,<br>
    Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,<br>
    That from the fact the word be not diverse.
</p>
<p>
O rabble ill-begotten above all,<br>
    Who’re in the place to speak of which is hard,<br>
    ’Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!
</p>
<p>
When we were down within the darksome well,<br>
    Beneath the giant’s feet, but lower far,<br>
    And I was scanning still the lofty wall,
</p>
<p>
I heard it said to me: “Look how thou steppest!<br>
    Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet<br>
    The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!”
</p>
<p>
Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me<br>
    And underfoot a lake, that from the frost<br>
    The semblance had of glass, and not of water.
</p>
<p>
So thick a veil ne’er made upon its current<br>
    In winter-time Danube in Austria,<br>
    Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,
</p>
<p>
As there was here; so that if Tambernich<br>
    Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,<br>
    E’en at the edge ’twould not have given a creak.
</p>
<p>
And as to croak the frog doth place himself<br>
    With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming<br>
    Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,—
</p>
<p>
Livid, as far down as where shame appears,<br>
    Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,<br>
    Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.
</p>
<p>
Each one his countenance held downward bent;<br>
    From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart<br>
    Among them witness of itself procures.
</p>
<p>
When round about me somewhat I had looked,<br>
    I downward turned me, and saw two so close,<br>
    The hair upon their heads together mingled.
</p>
<p>
“Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,”<br>
    I said, “who are you;” and they bent their necks,<br>
    And when to me their faces they had lifted,
</p>
<p>
Their eyes, which first were only moist within,<br>
    Gushed o’er the eyelids, and the frost congealed<br>
    The tears between, and locked them up again.
</p>
<p>
Clamp never bound together wood with wood<br>
    So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,<br>
    Butted together, so much wrath o’ercame them.
</p>
<p>
And one, who had by reason of the cold<br>
    Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,<br>
    Said: “Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?
</p>
<p>
If thou desire to know who these two are,<br>
    The valley whence Bisenzio descends<br>
    Belonged to them and to their father Albert.
</p>
<p>
They from one body came, and all Caina<br>
    Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade<br>
    More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;
</p>
<p>
Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow<br>
    At one and the same blow by Arthur’s hand;<br>
    Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers
</p>
<p>
So with his head I see no farther forward,<br>
    And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;<br>
    Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.
</p>
<p>
And that thou put me not to further speech,<br>
    Know that I Camicion de’ Pazzi was,<br>
    And wait Carlino to exonerate me.”
</p>
<p>
Then I beheld a thousand faces, made<br>
    Purple with cold; whence o’er me comes a shudder,<br>
    And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.
</p>
<p>
And while we were advancing tow’rds the middle,<br>
    Where everything of weight unites together,<br>
    And I was shivering in the eternal shade,
</p>
<p>
Whether ’twere will, or destiny, or chance,<br>
    I know not; but in walking ’mong the heads<br>
    I struck my foot hard in the face of one.
</p>
<p>
Weeping he growled: “Why dost thou trample me?<br>
    Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance<br>
    of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?”
</p>
<p>
And I: “My Master, now wait here for me,<br>
    That I through him may issue from a doubt;<br>
    Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.”
</p>
<p>
The Leader stopped; and to that one I said<br>
    Who was blaspheming vehemently still:<br>
    “Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?”
</p>
<p>
“Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora<br>
    Smiting,” replied he, “other people’s cheeks,<br>
    So that, if thou wert living, ’twere too much?”
</p>
<p>
“Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,”<br>
    Was my response, “if thou demandest fame,<br>
    That ’mid the other notes thy name I place.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “For the reverse I long;<br>
    Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;<br>
    For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.”
</p>
<p>
Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,<br>
    And said: “It must needs be thou name thyself,<br>
    Or not a hair remain upon thee here.”
</p>
<p>
Whence he to me: “Though thou strip off my hair,<br>
    I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,<br>
    If on my head a thousand times thou fall.”
</p>
<p>
I had his hair in hand already twisted,<br>
    And more than one shock of it had pulled out,<br>
    He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,
</p>
<p>
When cried another: “What doth ail thee, Bocca?<br>
    Is’t not enough to clatter with thy jaws,<br>
    But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?”
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said I, “I care not to have thee speak,<br>
    Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame<br>
    I will report of thee veracious news.”
</p>
<p>
“Begone,” replied he, “and tell what thou wilt,<br>
    But be not silent, if thou issue hence,<br>
    Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;
</p>
<p>
He weepeth here the silver of the French;<br>
    ‘I saw,’ thus canst thou phrase it, ‘him of Duera<br>
    There where the sinners stand out in the cold.’
</p>
<p>
If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,<br>
    Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,<br>
    Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;
</p>
<p>
Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be<br>
    Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello<br>
    Who oped Faenza when the people slep.”
</p>
<p>
Already we had gone away from him,<br>
    When I beheld two frozen in one hole,<br>
    So that one head a hood was to the other;
</p>
<p>
And even as bread through hunger is devoured,<br>
    The uppermost on the other set his teeth,<br>
    There where the brain is to the nape united.
</p>
<p>
Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed<br>
    The temples of Menalippus in disdain,<br>
    Than that one did the skull and the other things.
</p>
<p>
“O thou, who showest by such bestial sign<br>
    Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,<br>
    Tell me the wherefore,” said I, “with this compact,
</p>
<p>
That if thou rightfully of him complain,<br>
    In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,<br>
    I in the world above repay thee for it,
</p>
<p>
If that wherewith I speak be not dried up.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXXIII">
<p>
His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,<br>
    That sinner, wiping it upon the hair<br>
    Of the same head that he behind had wasted.
</p>
<p>
Then he began: “Thou wilt that I renew<br>
    The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already<br>
    To think of only, ere I speak of it;
</p>
<p>
But if my words be seed that may bear fruit<br>
    Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,<br>
    Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.
</p>
<p>
I know not who thou art, nor by what mode<br>
    Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine<br>
    Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.
</p>
<p>
Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,<br>
    And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;<br>
    Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.
</p>
<p>
That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,<br>
    Trusting in him I was made prisoner,<br>
    And after put to death, I need not say;
</p>
<p>
 But ne’ertheless what thou canst not have heard,<br>
    That is to say, how cruel was my death,<br>
    Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.
</p>
<p>
A narrow perforation in the mew,<br>
    Which bears because of me the title of Famine,<br>
    And in which others still must be locked up,
</p>
<p>
Had shown me through its opening many moons<br>
    Already, when I dreamed the evil dream<br>
    Which of the future rent for me the veil.
</p>
<p>
This one appeared to me as lord and master,<br>
    Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain<br>
    For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
</p>
<p>
With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,<br>
    Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi<br>
    He had sent out before him to the front.
</p>
<p>
After brief course seemed unto me forespent<br>
    The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes<br>
    It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.
</p>
<p>
When I before the morrow was awake,<br>
    Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons<br>
    Who with me were, and asking after bread.
</p>
<p>
Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,<br>
    Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,<br>
    And weep’st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?
</p>
<p>
They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh<br>
    At which our food used to be brought to us,<br>
    And through his dream was each one apprehensive;
</p>
<p>
And I heard locking up the under door<br>
    Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word<br>
    I gazed into the faces of my sons.
</p>
<p>
I wept not, I within so turned to stone;<br>
    They wept; and darling little Anselm mine<br>
    Said: ‘Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?’
</p>
<p>
Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made<br>
    All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,<br>
    Until another sun rose on the world.
</p>
<p>
As now a little glimmer made its way<br>
    Into the dolorous prison, and I saw<br>
    Upon four faces my own very aspect,
</p>
<p>
Both of my hands in agony I bit;<br>
    And, thinking that I did it from desire<br>
    Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,
</p>
<p>
And said they: ‘Father, much less pain ’twill give us<br>
    If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us<br>
    With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.’
</p>
<p>
I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.<br>
    That day we all were silent, and the next.<br>
    Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?
</p>
<p>
When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo<br>
    Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,<br>
    Saying, ‘My father, why dost thou not help me?’
</p>
<p>
And there he died; and, as thou seest me,<br>
    I saw the three fall, one by one, between<br>
    The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,
</p>
<p>
Already blind, to groping over each,<br>
    And three days called them after they were dead;<br>
    Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.”
</p>
<p>
When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,<br>
    The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,<br>
    Which, as a dog’s, upon the bone were strong.
</p>
<p>
Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people<br>
    Of the fair land there where the ‘Si’ doth sound,<br>
    Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,
</p>
<p>
Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,<br>
    And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno<br>
    That every person in thee it may drown!
</p>
<p>
For if Count Ugolino had the fame<br>
    Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,<br>
    Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.
</p>
<p>
Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!<br>
    Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,<br>
    And the other two my song doth name above!
</p>
<p>
We passed still farther onward, where the ice<br>
    Another people ruggedly enswathes,<br>
    Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.
</p>
<p>
Weeping itself there does not let them weep,<br>
    And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes<br>
    Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;
</p>
<p>
Because the earliest tears a cluster form,<br>
    And, in the manner of a crystal visor,<br>
    Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.
</p>
<p>
And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,<br>
    Because of cold all sensibility<br>
    Its station had abandoned in my face,
</p>
<p>
Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;<br>
    Whence I: “My Master, who sets this in motion?<br>
    Is not below here every vapour quenched?”
</p>
<p>
Whence he to me: “Full soon shalt thou be where<br>
    Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,<br>
    Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.”
</p>
<p>
And one of the wretches of the frozen crust<br>
    Cried out to us: “O souls so merciless<br>
    That the last post is given unto you,
</p>
<p>
Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I<br>
    May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart<br>
    A little, e’er the weeping recongeal.”
</p>
<p>
Whence I to him: “If thou wouldst have me help thee<br>
    Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,<br>
    May I go to the bottom of the ice.”
</p>
<p>
Then he replied: “I am Friar Alberigo;<br>
    He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,<br>
    Who here a date am getting for my fig.”
</p>
<p>
“O,” said I to him, “now art thou, too, dead?”<br>
    And he to me: “How may my body fare<br>
    Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.
</p>
<p>
Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,<br>
    That oftentimes the soul descendeth here<br>
    Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.
</p>
<p>
And, that thou mayest more willingly remove<br>
    From off my countenance these glassy tears,<br>
    Know that as soon as any soul betrays
</p>
<p>
As I have done, his body by a demon<br>
    Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,<br>
    Until his time has wholly been revolved.
</p>
<p>
Itself down rushes into such a cistern;<br>
    And still perchance above appears the body<br>
    Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.
</p>
<p>
This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;<br>
    It is Ser Branca d’ Oria, and many years<br>
    Have passed away since he was thus locked up.”
</p>
<p>
“I think,” said I to him, “thou dost deceive me;<br>
    For Branca d’ Oria is not dead as yet,<br>
    And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.”
</p>
<p>
“In moat above,” said he, “of Malebranche,<br>
    There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,<br>
    As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,
</p>
<p>
When this one left a devil in his stead<br>
    In his own body and one near of kin,<br>
    Who made together with him the betrayal.
</p>
<p>
But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,<br>
    Open mine eyes;”—and open them I did not,<br>
    And to be rude to him was courtesy.
</p>
<p>
Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance<br>
    With every virtue, full of every vice<br>
    Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?
</p>
<p>
For with the vilest spirit of Romagna<br>
    I found of you one such, who for his deeds<br>
    In soul already in Cocytus bathes,
</p>
<p>
And still above in body seems alive!

<div class="canto" id="CantoI.XXXIV">
<p>
“‘Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni’<br>
    Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,”<br>
    My Master said, “if thou discernest him.”
</p>
<p>
As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when<br>
    Our hemisphere is darkening into night,<br>
    Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,
</p>
<p>
Methought that such a building then I saw;<br>
    And, for the wind, I drew myself behind<br>
    My Guide, because there was no other shelter.
</p>
<p>
Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,<br>
    There where the shades were wholly covered up,<br>
    And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.
</p>
<p>
Some prone are lying, others stand erect,<br>
    This with the head, and that one with the soles;<br>
    Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.
</p>
<p>
When in advance so far we had proceeded,<br>
    That it my Master pleased to show to me<br>
    The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,
</p>
<p>
He from before me moved and made me stop,<br>
    Saying: “Behold Dis, and behold the place<br>
    Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.”
</p>
<p>
How frozen I became and powerless then,<br>
    Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,<br>
    Because all language would be insufficient.
</p>
<p>
I did not die, and I alive remained not;<br>
    Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,<br>
    What I became, being of both deprived.
</p>
<p>
The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous<br>
    From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;<br>
    And better with a giant I compare
</p>
<p>
Than do the giants with those arms of his;<br>
    Consider now how great must be that whole,<br>
    Which unto such a part conforms itself.
</p>
<p>
Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,<br>
    And lifted up his brow against his Maker,<br>
    Well may proceed from him all tribulation.
</p>
<p>
O, what a marvel it appeared to me,<br>
    When I beheld three faces on his head!<br>
    The one in front, and that vermilion was;
</p>
<p>
Two were the others, that were joined with this<br>
    Above the middle part of either shoulder,<br>
    And they were joined together at the crest;
</p>
<p>
And the right-hand one seemed ’twixt white and yellow;<br>
    The left was such to look upon as those<br>
    Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.
</p>
<p>
Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,<br>
    Such as befitting were so great a bird;<br>
    Sails of the sea I never saw so large.
</p>
<p>
 No feathers had they, but as of a bat<br>
    Their fashion was; and he was waving them,<br>
    So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.
</p>
<p>
Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.<br>
    With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins<br>
    Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.
</p>
<p>
At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching<br>
    A sinner, in the manner of a brake,<br>
    So that he three of them tormented thus.
</p>
<p>
To him in front the biting was as naught<br>
    Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine<br>
    Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.
</p>
<p>
“That soul up there which has the greatest pain,”<br>
    The Master said, “is Judas Iscariot;<br>
    With head inside, he plies his legs without.
</p>
<p>
Of the two others, who head downward are,<br>
    The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;<br>
    See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.
</p>
<p>
And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.<br>
    But night is reascending, and ’tis time<br>
    That we depart, for we have seen the whole.”
</p>
<p>
As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,<br>
    And he the vantage seized of time and place,<br>
    And when the wings were opened wide apart,
</p>
<p>
He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;<br>
    From fell to fell descended downward then<br>
    Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.
</p>
<p>
When we were come to where the thigh revolves<br>
    Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,<br>
    The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,
</p>
<p>
Turned round his head where he had had his legs,<br>
    And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,<br>
    So that to Hell I thought we were returning.
</p>
<p>
“Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,”<br>
    The Master said, panting as one fatigued,<br>
    “Must we perforce depart from so much evil.”
</p>
<p>
Then through the opening of a rock he issued,<br>
    And down upon the margin seated me;<br>
    Then tow’rds me he outstretched his wary step.
</p>
<p>
I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see<br>
    Lucifer in the same way I had left him;<br>
    And I beheld him upward hold his legs.
</p>
<p>
And if I then became disquieted,<br>
    Let stolid people think who do not see<br>
    What the point is beyond which I had passed.
</p>
<p>
“Rise up,” the Master said, “upon thy feet;<br>
    The way is long, and difficult the road,<br>
    And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.”
</p>
<p>
It was not any palace corridor<br>
    There where we were, but dungeon natural,<br>
    With floor uneven and unease of light.
</p>
<p>
“Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,<br>
    My Master,” said I when I had arisen,<br>
    “To draw me from an error speak a little;
</p>
<p>
Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed<br>
    Thus upside down? and how in such short time<br>
    From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Thou still imaginest<br>
    Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped<br>
    The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.
</p>
<p>
That side thou wast, so long as I descended;<br>
    When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point<br>
    To which things heavy draw from every side,
</p>
<p>
And now beneath the hemisphere art come<br>
    Opposite that which overhangs the vast<br>
    Dry-land, and ’neath whose cope was put to death
</p>
<p>
The Man who without sin was born and lived.<br>
    Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere<br>
    Which makes the other face of the Judecca.
</p>
<p>
Here it is morn when it is evening there;<br>
    And he who with his hair a stairway made us<br>
    Still fixed remaineth as he was before.
</p>
<p>
Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;<br>
    And all the land, that whilom here emerged,<br>
    For fear of him made of the sea a veil,
</p>
<p>
And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure<br>
    To flee from him, what on this side appears<br>
    Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.”
</p>
<p>
A place there is below, from Beelzebub<br>
    As far receding as the tomb extends,<br>
    Which not by sight is known, but by the sound
</p>
<p>
Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth<br>
    Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed<br>
    With course that winds about and slightly falls.
</p>
<p>
The Guide and I into that hidden road<br>
    Now entered, to return to the bright world;<br>
    And without care of having any rest
</p>
<p>
We mounted up, he first and I the second,<br>
    Till I beheld through a round aperture<br>
    Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;
</p>
<p>
Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.I">
<p>
To run o’er better waters hoists its sail<br>
    The little vessel of my genius now,<br>
    That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;
</p>
<p>
And of that second kingdom will I sing<br>
    Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,<br>
    And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.
</p>
<p>
But let dead Poesy here rise again,<br>
    O holy Muses, since that I am yours,<br>
    And here Calliope somewhat ascend,
</p>
<p>
My song accompanying with that sound,<br>
    Of which the miserable magpies felt<br>
    The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.
</p>
<p>
Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,<br>
    That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect<br>
    Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,
</p>
<p>
Unto mine eyes did recommence delight<br>
    Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,<br>
    Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.
</p>
<p>
The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<br>
    Was making all the orient to laugh,<br>
    Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.
</p>
<p>
To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br>
    Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<br>
    Ne’er seen before save by the primal people.
</p>
<p>
Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.<br>
    O thou septentrional and widowed site,<br>
    Because thou art deprived of seeing these!
</p>
<p>
When from regarding them I had withdrawn,<br>
    Turning a little to the other pole,<br>
    There where the Wain had disappeared already,
</p>
<p>
I saw beside me an old man alone,<br>
    Worthy of so much reverence in his look,<br>
    That more owes not to father any son.
</p>
<p>
A long beard and with white hair intermingled<br>
    He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,<br>
    Of which a double list fell on his breast.
</p>
<p>
The rays of the four consecrated stars<br>
    Did so adorn his countenance with light,<br>
    That him I saw as were the sun before him.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<br>
    Have fled away from the eternal prison?”<br>
    Moving those venerable plumes, he said:
</p>
<p>
“Who guided you? or who has been your lamp<br>
    In issuing forth out of the night profound,<br>
    That ever black makes the infernal valley?
</p>
<p>
The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?<br>
    Or is there changed in heaven some council new,<br>
    That being damned ye come unto my crags?”
</p>
<p>
Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,<br>
    And with his words, and with his hands and signs,<br>
    Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;
</p>
<p>
Then answered him: “I came not of myself;<br>
    A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers<br>
    I aided this one with my company.
</p>
<p>
But since it is thy will more be unfolded<br>
    Of our condition, how it truly is,<br>
    Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.
</p>
<p>
This one has never his last evening seen,<br>
    But by his folly was so near to it<br>
    That very little time was there to turn.
</p>
<p>
As I have said, I unto him was sent<br>
    To rescue him, and other way was none<br>
    Than this to which I have myself betaken.
</p>
<p>
I’ve shown him all the people of perdition,<br>
    And now those spirits I intend to show<br>
    Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.
</p>
<p>
How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.<br>
    Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me<br>
    To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.
</p>
<p>
Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;<br>
    He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,<br>
    As knoweth he who life for her refuses.
</p>
<p>
Thou know’st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter<br>
    Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave<br>
    The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.
</p>
<p>
By us the eternal edicts are not broken;<br>
    Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<br>
    But of that circle I, where are the chaste
</p>
<p>
Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,<br>
    O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;<br>
    For her love, then, incline thyself to us.
</p>
<p>
Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;<br>
    I will take back this grace from thee to her,<br>
    If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.”
</p>
<p>
“Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes<br>
    While I was on the other side,” then said he,<br>
    “That every grace she wished of me I granted;
</p>
<p>
Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,<br>
    She can no longer move me, by that law<br>
    Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.
</p>
<p>
But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,<br>
    As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;<br>
    Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.
</p>
<p>
Go, then, and see thou gird this one about<br>
    With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<br>
    So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,
</p>
<p>
For ’twere not fitting that the eye o’ercast<br>
    By any mist should go before the first<br>
    Angel, who is of those of Paradise.
</p>
<p>
This little island round about its base<br>
    Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,<br>
    Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;
</p>
<p>
No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,<br>
    Or that doth indurate, can there have life,<br>
    Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter be not this way your return;<br>
    The sun, which now is rising, will direct you<br>
    To take the mount by easier ascent.”
</p>
<p>
With this he vanished; and I raised me up<br>
    Without a word, and wholly drew myself<br>
    Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.
</p>
<p>
And he began: “Son, follow thou my steps;<br>
    Let us turn back, for on this side declines<br>
    The plain unto its lower boundaries.”
</p>
<p>
The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<br>
    Which fled before it, so that from afar<br>
    I recognised the trembling of the sea.
</p>
<p>
Along the solitary plain we went<br>
    As one who unto the lost road returns,<br>
    And till he finds it seems to go in vain.
</p>
<p>
As soon as we were come to where the dew<br>
    Fights with the sun, and, being in a part<br>
    Where shadow falls, little evaporates,
</p>
<p>
Both of his hands upon the grass outspread<br>
    In gentle manner did my Master place;<br>
    Whence I, who of his action was aware,
</p>
<p>
Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;<br>
    There did he make in me uncovered wholly<br>
    That hue which Hell had covered up in me.
</p>
<p>
Then came we down upon the desert shore<br>
    Which never yet saw navigate its waters<br>
    Any that afterward had known return.
</p>
<p>
There he begirt me as the other pleased;<br>
    O marvellous! for even as he culled<br>
    The humble plant, such it sprang up again
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there where he uprooted it.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.II">
<p>
Already had the sun the horizon reached<br>
    Whose circle of meridian covers o’er<br>
    Jerusalem with its most lofty point,
</p>
<p>
And night that opposite to him revolves<br>
    Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales<br>
    That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;
</p>
<p>
So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<br>
    Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,<br>
    By too great age were changing into orange.
</p>
<p>
We still were on the border of the sea,<br>
    Like people who are thinking of their road,<br>
    Who go in heart and with the body stay;
</p>
<p>
And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,<br>
    Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red<br>
    Down in the West upon the ocean floor,
</p>
<p>
Appeared to me—may I again behold it!—<br>
    A light along the sea so swiftly coming,<br>
    Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;
</p>
<p>
From which when I a little had withdrawn<br>
    Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,<br>
    Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.
</p>
<p>
Then on each side of it appeared to me<br>
    I knew not what of white, and underneath it<br>
    Little by little there came forth another.
</p>
<p>
My Master yet had uttered not a word<br>
    While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;<br>
    But when he clearly recognised the pilot,
</p>
<p>
He cried: “Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!<br>
    Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!<br>
    Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!
</p>
<p>
See how he scorneth human arguments,<br>
    So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail<br>
    Than his own wings, between so distant shores.
</p>
<p>
See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,<br>
    Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,<br>
    That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!”
</p>
<p>
Then as still nearer and more near us came<br>
    The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,<br>
    So that near by the eye could not endure him,
</p>
<p>
But down I cast it; and he came to shore<br>
    With a small vessel, very swift and light,<br>
    So that the water swallowed naught thereof.
</p>
<p>
Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;<br>
    Beatitude seemed written in his face,<br>
    And more than a hundred spirits sat within.
</p>
<p>
“In exitu Israel de Aegypto!”<br>
    They chanted all together in one voice,<br>
    With whatso in that psalm is after written.
</p>
<p>
Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,<br>
    Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,<br>
    And he departed swiftly as he came.
</p>
<p>
The throng which still remained there unfamiliar<br>
    Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,<br>
    As one who in new matters makes essay.
</p>
<p>
On every side was darting forth the day.<br>
    The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts<br>
    From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,
</p>
<p>
When the new people lifted up their faces<br>
    Towards us, saying to us: “If ye know,<br>
    Show us the way to go unto the mountain.”
</p>
<p>
And answer made Virgilius: “Ye believe<br>
    Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,<br>
    But we are strangers even as yourselves.
</p>
<p>
Just now we came, a little while before you,<br>
    Another way, which was so rough and steep,<br>
    That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.”
</p>
<p>
The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,<br>
    Become aware that I was still alive,<br>
    Pallid in their astonishment became;
</p>
<p>
And as to messenger who bears the olive<br>
    The people throng to listen to the news,<br>
    And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,
</p>
<p>
So at the sight of me stood motionless<br>
    Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if<br>
    Oblivious to go and make them fair.
</p>
<p>
One from among them saw I coming forward,<br>
    As to embrace me, with such great affection,<br>
    That it incited me to do the like.
</p>
<p>
O empty shadows, save in aspect only!<br>
    Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<br>
    As oft returned with them to my own breast!
</p>
<p>
I think with wonder I depicted me;<br>
    Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;<br>
    And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.
</p>
<p>
Gently it said that I should stay my steps;<br>
    Then knew I who it was, and I entreated<br>
    That it would stop awhile to speak with me.
</p>
<p>
It made reply to me: “Even as I loved thee<br>
    In mortal body, so I love thee free;<br>
    Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”
</p>
<p>
“My own Casella! to return once more<br>
    There where I am, I make this journey,” said I;<br>
    “But how from thee has so much time be taken?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “No outrage has been done me,<br>
    If he who takes both when and whom he pleases<br>
    Has many times denied to me this passage,
</p>
<p>
For of a righteous will his own is made.<br>
    He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<br>
    Whoever wished to enter with all peace;
</p>
<p>
Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<br>
    Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,<br>
    Benignantly by him have been received.
</p>
<p>
Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,<br>
    Because for evermore assemble there<br>
    Those who tow’rds Acheron do not descend.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “If some new law take not from thee<br>
    Memory or practice of the song of love,<br>
    Which used to quiet in me all my longings,
</p>
<p>
Thee may it please to comfort therewithal<br>
    Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body<br>
    Hitherward coming is so much distressed.”
</p>
<p>
“Love, that within my mind discourses with me,”<br>
    Forthwith began he so melodiously,<br>
    The melody within me still is sounding.
</p>
<p>
My Master, and myself, and all that people<br>
    Which with him were, appeared as satisfied<br>
    As if naught else might touch the mind of any.
</p>
<p>
We all of us were moveless and attentive<br>
    Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,<br>
    Exclaiming: “What is this, ye laggard spirits?
</p>
<p>
What negligence, what standing still is this?<br>
    Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,<br>
    That lets not God be manifest to you.”
</p>
<p>
Even as when, collecting grain or tares,<br>
    The doves, together at their pasture met,<br>
    Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,
</p>
<p>
If aught appear of which they are afraid,<br>
    Upon a sudden leave their food alone,<br>
    Because they are assailed by greater care;
</p>
<p>
So that fresh company did I behold<br>
    The song relinquish, and go tow’rds the hill,<br>
    As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;
</p>
<p>
Nor was our own departure less in haste.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.III">
<p>
Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight<br>
    Had scattered them asunder o’er the plain,<br>
    Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,
</p>
<p>
I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,<br>
    And how without him had I kept my course?<br>
    Who would have led me up along the mountain?
</p>
<p>
He seemed to me within himself remorseful;<br>
    O noble conscience, and without a stain,<br>
    How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!
</p>
<p>
After his feet had laid aside the haste<br>
    Which mars the dignity of every act,<br>
    My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,
</p>
<p>
Let loose its faculties as if delighted,<br>
    And I my sight directed to the hill<br>
    That highest tow’rds the heaven uplifts itself.
</p>
<p>
The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,<br>
    Was broken in front of me into the figure<br>
    Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;
</p>
<p>
Unto one side I turned me, with the fear<br>
    Of being left alone, when I beheld<br>
    Only in front of me the ground obscured.
</p>
<p>
“Why dost thou still mistrust?” my Comforter<br>
    Began to say to me turned wholly round;<br>
    “Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?
</p>
<p>
’Tis evening there already where is buried<br>
    The body within which I cast a shadow;<br>
    ’Tis from Brundusium ta’en, and Naples has it.
</p>
<p>
Now if in front of me no shadow fall,<br>
    Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,<br>
    Because one ray impedeth not another
</p>
<p>
To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,<br>
    Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills<br>
    That how it works be not unveiled to us.
</p>
<p>
Insane is he who hopeth that our reason<br>
    Can traverse the illimitable way,<br>
    Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!
</p>
<p>
Mortals, remain contented at the ‘Quia;’<br>
    For if ye had been able to see all,<br>
    No need there were for Mary to give birth;
</p>
<p>
And ye have seen desiring without fruit,<br>
    Those whose desire would have been quieted,<br>
    Which evermore is given them for a grief.
</p>
<p>
I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,<br>
    And many others;”—and here bowed his head,<br>
    And more he said not, and remained disturbed.
</p>
<p>
We came meanwhile unto the mountain’s foot;<br>
    There so precipitate we found the rock,<br>
    That nimble legs would there have been in vain.
</p>
<p>
’Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,<br>
    The most secluded pathway is a stair<br>
    Easy and open, if compared with that.
</p>
<p>
“Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill<br>
    Slopes down,” my Master said, his footsteps staying,<br>
    “So that who goeth without wings may mount?”
</p>
<p>
And while he held his eyes upon the ground<br>
    Examining the nature of the path,<br>
    And I was looking up around the rock,
</p>
<p>
On the left hand appeared to me a throng<br>
    Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,<br>
    And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Lift up thine eyes,” I to the Master said;<br>
    “Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,<br>
    If thou of thine own self can have it not.”
</p>
<p>
Then he looked at me, and with frank expression<br>
    Replied: “Let us go there, for they come slowly,<br>
    And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.”
</p>
<p>
Still was that people as far off from us,<br>
    After a thousand steps of ours I say,<br>
    As a good thrower with his hand would reach,
</p>
<p>
When they all crowded unto the hard masses<br>
    Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,<br>
    As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.
</p>
<p>
“O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!”<br>
    Virgilius made beginning, “by that peace<br>
    Which I believe is waiting for you all,
</p>
<p>
Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,<br>
    So that the going up be possible,<br>
    For to lose time irks him most who most knows.”
</p>
<p>
As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold<br>
    By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand<br>
    Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,
</p>
<p>
And what the foremost does the others do,<br>
    Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,<br>
    Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;
</p>
<p>
So moving to approach us thereupon<br>
    I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,<br>
    Modest in face and dignified in gait.
</p>
<p>
As soon as those in the advance saw broken<br>
    The light upon the ground at my right side,<br>
    So that from me the shadow reached the rock,
</p>
<p>
They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;<br>
    And all the others, who came after them,<br>
    Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.
</p>
<p>
“Without your asking, I confess to you<br>
    This is a human body which you see,<br>
    Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.
</p>
<p>
Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded<br>
    That not without a power which comes from Heaven<br>
    Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.”
</p>
<p>
The Master thus; and said those worthy people:<br>
    “Return ye then, and enter in before us,”<br>
    Making a signal with the back o’ the hand
</p>
<p>
And one of them began: “Whoe’er thou art,<br>
    Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well<br>
    If e’er thou saw me in the other world.”
</p>
<p>
I turned me tow’rds him, and looked at him closely;<br>
    Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,<br>
    But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.
</p>
<p>
When with humility I had disclaimed<br>
    E’er having seen him, “Now behold!” he said,<br>
    And showed me high upon his breast a wound.
</p>
<p>
Then said he with a smile: “I am Manfredi,<br>
    The grandson of the Empress Costanza;<br>
    Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee
</p>
<p>
Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother<br>
    Of Sicily’s honour and of Aragon’s,<br>
    And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.
</p>
<p>
After I had my body lacerated<br>
    By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself<br>
    Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.
</p>
<p>
Horrible my iniquities had been;<br>
    But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,<br>
    That it receives whatever turns to it.
</p>
<p>
Had but Cosenza’s pastor, who in chase<br>
    Of me was sent by Clement at that time,<br>
    In God read understandingly this page,
</p>
<p>
The bones of my dead body still would be<br>
    At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,<br>
    Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.
</p>
<p>
Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,<br>
    Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,<br>
    Where he transported them with tapers quenched.
</p>
<p>
By malison of theirs is not so lost<br>
    Eternal Love, that it cannot return,<br>
    So long as hope has anything of green.
</p>
<p>
True is it, who in contumacy dies<br>
    Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,<br>
    Must wait upon the outside this bank
</p>
<p>
Thirty times told the time that he has been<br>
    In his presumption, unless such decree<br>
    Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.
</p>
<p>
See now if thou hast power to make me happy,<br>
    By making known unto my good Costanza<br>
    How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,
</p>
<p>
For those on earth can much advance us here.”

<p>
Whenever by delight or else by pain,<br>
    That seizes any faculty of ours,<br>
    Wholly to that the soul collects itself,
</p>
<p>
It seemeth that no other power it heeds;<br>
    And this against that error is which thinks<br>
    One soul above another kindles in us.
</p>
<p>
And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen<br>
    Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,<br>
    Time passes on, and we perceive it not,
</p>
<p>
Because one faculty is that which listens,<br>
    And other that which the soul keeps entire;<br>
    This is as if in bonds, and that is free.
</p>
<p>
Of this I had experience positive<br>
    In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;<br>
    For fifty full degrees uprisen was
</p>
<p>
The sun, and I had not perceived it, when<br>
    We came to where those souls with one accord<br>
    Cried out unto us: “Here is what you ask.”
</p>
<p>
A greater opening ofttimes hedges up<br>
    With but a little forkful of his thorns<br>
    The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,
</p>
<p>
Than was the passage-way through which ascended<br>
    Only my Leader and myself behind him,<br>
    After that company departed from us.
</p>
<p>
One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,<br>
    And mounts the summit of Bismantova,<br>
    With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;
</p>
<p>
With the swift pinions and the plumes I say<br>
    Of great desire, conducted after him<br>
    Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.
</p>
<p>
We mounted upward through the rifted rock,<br>
    And on each side the border pressed upon us,<br>
    And feet and hands the ground beneath required.
</p>
<p>
When we were come upon the upper rim<br>
    Of the high bank, out on the open slope,<br>
    “My Master,” said I, “what way shall we take?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “No step of thine descend;<br>
    Still up the mount behind me win thy way,<br>
    Till some sage escort shall appear to us.”
</p>
<p>
The summit was so high it vanquished sight,<br>
    And the hillside precipitous far more<br>
    Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.
</p>
<p>
Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:<br>
    “O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold<br>
    How I remain alone, unless thou stay!”
</p>
<p>
“O son,” he said, “up yonder drag thyself,”<br>
    Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,<br>
    Which on that side encircles all the hill.
</p>
<p>
These words of his so spurred me on, that I<br>
    Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,<br>
    Until the circle was beneath my feet.
</p>
<p>
Thereon ourselves we seated both of us<br>
    Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,<br>
    For all men are delighted to look back.
</p>
<p>
To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,<br>
    Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered<br>
    That on the left hand we were smitten by it.
</p>
<p>
The Poet well perceived that I was wholly<br>
    Bewildered at the chariot of the light,<br>
    Where ’twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.
</p>
<p>
Whereon he said to me: “If Castor and Pollux<br>
    Were in the company of yonder mirror,<br>
    That up and down conducteth with its light,
</p>
<p>
Thou wouldst behold the zodiac’s jagged wheel<br>
    Revolving still more near unto the Bears,<br>
    Unless it swerved aside from its old track.
</p>
<p>
How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,<br>
    Collected in thyself, imagine Zion<br>
    Together with this mount on earth to stand,
</p>
<p>
So that they both one sole horizon have,<br>
    And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road<br>
    Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,
</p>
<p>
Thou’lt see how of necessity must pass<br>
    This on one side, when that upon the other,<br>
    If thine intelligence right clearly heed.”
</p>
<p>
“Truly, my Master,” said I, “never yet<br>
    Saw I so clearly as I now discern,<br>
    There where my wit appeared incompetent,
</p>
<p>
That the mid-circle of supernal motion,<br>
    Which in some art is the Equator called,<br>
    And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,
</p>
<p>
For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence<br>
    Tow’rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews<br>
    Beheld it tow’rds the region of the heat.
</p>
<p>
But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn<br>
    How far we have to go; for the hill rises<br>
    Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “This mount is such, that ever<br>
    At the beginning down below ’tis tiresome,<br>
    And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,<br>
    That going up shall be to thee as easy<br>
    As going down the current in a boat,
</p>
<p>
Then at this pathway’s ending thou wilt be;<br>
    There to repose thy panting breath expect;<br>
    No more I answer; and this I know for true.”
</p>
<p>
And as he finished uttering these words,<br>
    A voice close by us sounded: “Peradventure<br>
    Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.”
</p>
<p>
At sound thereof each one of us turned round,<br>
    And saw upon the left hand a great rock,<br>
    Which neither I nor he before had noticed.
</p>
<p>
Thither we drew; and there were persons there<br>
    Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,<br>
    As one through indolence is wont to stand.
</p>
<p>
And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,<br>
    Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,<br>
    Holding his face low down between them bowed.
</p>
<p>
“O my sweet Lord,” I said, “do turn thine eye<br>
    On him who shows himself more negligent<br>
    Then even Sloth herself his sister were.”
</p>
<p>
Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,<br>
    Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,<br>
    And said: “Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.”
</p>
<p>
Then knew I who he was; and the distress,<br>
    That still a little did my breathing quicken,<br>
    My going to him hindered not; and after
</p>
<p>
I came to him he hardly raised his head,<br>
    Saying: “Hast thou seen clearly how the sun<br>
    O’er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?”
</p>
<p>
His sluggish attitude and his curt words<br>
    A little unto laughter moved my lips;<br>
    Then I began: “Belacqua, I grieve not
</p>
<p>
For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated<br>
    In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?<br>
    Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?”
</p>
<p>
And he: “O brother, what’s the use of climbing?<br>
    Since to my torment would not let me go<br>
    The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.
</p>
<p>
First heaven must needs so long revolve me round<br>
    Outside thereof, as in my life it did,<br>
    Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,
</p>
<p>
Unless, e’er that, some prayer may bring me aid<br>
    Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;<br>
    What profit others that in heaven are heard not?”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,<br>
    And saying: “Come now; see the sun has touched<br>
    Meridian, and from the shore the night
</p>
<p>
Covers already with her foot Morocco.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.V">
<p>
I had already from those shades departed,<br>
    And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,<br>
    When from behind, pointing his finger at me,
</p>
<p>
One shouted: “See, it seems as if shone not<br>
    The sunshine on the left of him below,<br>
    And like one living seems he to conduct him.”
</p>
<p>
Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,<br>
    And saw them watching with astonishment<br>
    But me, but me, and the light which was broken!
</p>
<p>
“Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,”<br>
    The Master said, “that thou thy pace dost slacken?<br>
    What matters it to thee what here is whispered?
</p>
<p>
Come after me, and let the people talk;<br>
    Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags<br>
    Its top for all the blowing of the winds;
</p>
<p>
For evermore the man in whom is springing<br>
    Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,<br>
    Because the force of one the other weakens.”
</p>
<p>
What could I say in answer but “I come”?<br>
    I said it somewhat with that colour tinged<br>
    Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile along the mountain-side across<br>
    Came people in advance of us a little,<br>
    Singing the Miserere verse by verse.
</p>
<p>
When they became aware I gave no place<br>
    For passage of the sunshine through my body,<br>
    They changed their song into a long, hoarse “Oh!”
</p>
<p>
And two of them, in form of messengers,<br>
    Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,<br>
    “Of your condition make us cognisant.”
</p>
<p>
And said my Master: “Ye can go your way<br>
    And carry back again to those who sent you,<br>
    That this one’s body is of very flesh.
</p>
<p>
If they stood still because they saw his shadow,<br>
    As I suppose, enough is answered them;<br>
    Him let them honour, it may profit them.”
</p>
<p>
Vapours enkindled saw I ne’er so swiftly<br>
    At early nightfall cleave the air serene,<br>
    Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,
</p>
<p>
But upward they returned in briefer time,<br>
    And, on arriving, with the others wheeled<br>
    Tow’rds us, like troops that run without a rein.
</p>
<p>
“This folk that presses unto us is great,<br>
    And cometh to implore thee,” said the Poet;<br>
    “So still go onward, and in going listen.”
</p>
<p>
“O soul that goest to beatitude<br>
    With the same members wherewith thou wast born,”<br>
    Shouting they came, “a little stay thy steps,
</p>
<p>
Look, if thou e’er hast any of us seen,<br>
    So that o’er yonder thou bear news of him;<br>
    Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?
</p>
<p>
Long since we all were slain by violence,<br>
    And sinners even to the latest hour;<br>
    Then did a light from heaven admonish us,
</p>
<p>
So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth<br>
    From life we issued reconciled to God,<br>
    Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “Although I gaze into your faces,<br>
    No one I recognize; but if may please you<br>
    Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,
</p>
<p>
Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace<br>
    Which, following the feet of such a Guide,<br>
    From world to world makes itself sought by me.”
</p>
<p>
And one began: “Each one has confidence<br>
    In thy good offices without an oath,<br>
    Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;
</p>
<p>
Whence I, who speak alone before the others,<br>
    Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land<br>
    That ’twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,
</p>
<p>
Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers<br>
    In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,<br>
    That I may purge away my grave offences.
</p>
<p>
From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which<br>
    Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,<br>
    Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,
</p>
<p>
There where I thought to be the most secure;<br>
    ’Twas he of Este had it done, who held me<br>
    In hatred far beyond what justice willed.
</p>
<p>
But if towards the Mira I had fled,<br>
    When I was overtaken at Oriaco,<br>
    I still should be o’er yonder where men breathe.
</p>
<p>
I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire<br>
    Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there<br>
    A lake made from my veins upon the ground.”
</p>
<p>
Then said another: “Ah, be that desire<br>
    Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,<br>
    As thou with pious pity aidest mine.
</p>
<p>
I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;<br>
    Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;<br>
    Hence among these I go with downcast front.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “What violence or what chance<br>
    Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,<br>
    That never has thy sepulture been known?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” he replied, “at Casentino’s foot<br>
    A river crosses named Archiano, born<br>
    Above the Hermitage in Apennine.
</p>
<p>
There where the name thereof becometh void<br>
    Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,<br>
    Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;
</p>
<p>
There my sight lost I, and my utterance<br>
    Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat<br>
    I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.
</p>
<p>
Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;<br>
    God’s Angel took me up, and he of hell<br>
    Shouted: ‘O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?
</p>
<p>
Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,<br>
    For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;<br>
    But with the rest I’ll deal in other fashion!’
</p>
<p>
Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered<br>
    That humid vapour which to water turns,<br>
    Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.
</p>
<p>
He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,<br>
    To intellect, and moved the mist and wind<br>
    By means of power, which his own nature gave;
</p>
<p>
Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley<br>
    From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered<br>
    With fog, and made the heaven above intent,
</p>
<p>
So that the pregnant air to water changed;<br>
    Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came<br>
    Whate’er of it earth tolerated not;
</p>
<p>
And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,<br>
    Towards the royal river with such speed<br>
    It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.
</p>
<p>
My frozen body near unto its outlet<br>
    The robust Archian found, and into Arno<br>
    Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross
</p>
<p>
I made of me, when agony o’ercame me;<br>
    It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,<br>
    Then with its booty covered and begirt me.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,<br>
    And rested thee from thy long journeying,”<br>
    After the second followed the third spirit,
</p>
<p>
“Do thou remember me who am the Pia;<br>
    Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;<br>
    He knoweth it, who had encircled first,
</p>
<p>
Espousing me, my finger with his gem.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.VI">
<p>
Whene’er is broken up the game of Zara,<br>
    He who has lost remains behind despondent,<br>
    The throws repeating, and in sadness learns;
</p>
<p>
The people with the other all depart;<br>
    One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him,<br>
    And at his side one brings himself to mind;
</p>
<p>
He pauses not, and this and that one hears;<br>
    They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches,<br>
    And from the throng he thus defends himself.
</p>
<p>
Even such was I in that dense multitude,<br>
    Turning to them this way and that my face,<br>
    And, promising, I freed myself therefrom.
</p>
<p>
There was the Aretine, who from the arms<br>
    Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death,<br>
    And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned.
</p>
<p>
There was imploring with his hands outstretched<br>
    Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa<br>
    Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.
</p>
<p>
I saw Count Orso; and the soul divided<br>
    By hatred and by envy from its body,<br>
    As it declared, and not for crime committed,
</p>
<p>
Pierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide<br>
    While still on earth the Lady of Brabant,<br>
    So that for this she be of no worse flock!
</p>
<p>
As soon as I was free from all those shades<br>
    Who only prayed that some one else may pray,<br>
    So as to hasten their becoming holy,
</p>
<p>
Began I: “It appears that thou deniest,<br>
    O light of mine, expressly in some text,<br>
    That orison can bend decree of Heaven;
</p>
<p>
And ne’ertheless these people pray for this.<br>
    Might then their expectation bootless be?<br>
    Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “My writing is explicit,<br>
    And not fallacious is the hope of these,<br>
    If with sane intellect ’tis well regarded;
</p>
<p>
For top of judgment doth not vail itself,<br>
    Because the fire of love fulfils at once<br>
    What he must satisfy who here installs him.
</p>
<p>
And there, where I affirmed that proposition,<br>
    Defect was not amended by a prayer,<br>
    Because the prayer from God was separate.
</p>
<p>
Verily, in so deep a questioning<br>
    Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,<br>
    Who light ’twixt truth and intellect shall be.
</p>
<p>
I know not if thou understand; I speak<br>
    Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,<br>
    Smiling and happy, on this mountain’s top.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “Good Leader, let us make more haste,<br>
    For I no longer tire me as before;<br>
    And see, e’en now the hill a shadow casts.”
</p>
<p>
“We will go forward with this day” he answered,<br>
    “As far as now is possible for us;<br>
    But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.
</p>
<p>
Ere thou art up there, thou shalt see return<br>
    Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,<br>
    So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.
</p>
<p>
But yonder there behold! a soul that stationed<br>
    All, all alone is looking hitherward;<br>
    It will point out to us the quickest way.”
</p>
<p>
We came up unto it; O Lombard soul,<br>
    How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,<br>
    And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!
</p>
<p>
Nothing whatever did it say to us,<br>
    But let us go our way, eying us only<br>
    After the manner of a couchant lion;
</p>
<p>
Still near to it Virgilius drew, entreating<br>
    That it would point us out the best ascent;<br>
    And it replied not unto his demand,
</p>
<p>
But of our native land and of our life<br>
    It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:<br>
    “Mantua,”—and the shade, all in itself recluse,
</p>
<p>
Rose tow’rds him from the place where first it was,<br>
    Saying: “O Mantuan, I am Sordello<br>
    Of thine own land!” and one embraced the other.
</p>
<p>
Ah! servile Italy, grief’s hostelry!<br>
    A ship without a pilot in great tempest!<br>
    No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!
</p>
<p>
That noble soul was so impatient, only<br>
    At the sweet sound of his own native land,<br>
    To make its citizen glad welcome there;
</p>
<p>
And now within thee are not without war<br>
    Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other<br>
    Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in!
</p>
<p>
Search, wretched one, all round about the shores<br>
    Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,<br>
    If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!
</p>
<p>
What boots it, that for thee Justinian<br>
    The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle?<br>
    Withouten this the shame would be the less.
</p>
<p>
Ah! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,<br>
    And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,<br>
    If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,
</p>
<p>
Behold how fell this wild beast has become,<br>
    Being no longer by the spur corrected,<br>
    Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.
</p>
<p>
O German Albert! who abandonest<br>
    Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage,<br>
    And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,
</p>
<p>
May a just judgment from the stars down fall<br>
    Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,<br>
    That thy successor may have fear thereof;
</p>
<p>
Because thy father and thyself have suffered,<br>
    By greed of those transalpine lands distrained,<br>
    The garden of the empire to be waste.
</p>
<p>
Come and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti,<br>
    Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man!<br>
    Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed!
</p>
<p>
Come, cruel one! come and behold the oppression<br>
    Of thy nobility, and cure their wounds,<br>
    And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore!
</p>
<p>
Come and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting,<br>
    Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims,<br>
    “My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?”
</p>
<p>
Come and behold how loving are the people;<br>
    And if for us no pity moveth thee,<br>
    Come and be made ashamed of thy renown!
</p>
<p>
And if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme!<br>
    Who upon earth for us wast crucified,<br>
    Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere?
</p>
<p>
Or preparation is ’t, that, in the abyss<br>
    Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest<br>
    From our perception utterly cut off?
</p>
<p>
For all the towns of Italy are full<br>
    Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus<br>
    Each peasant churl who plays the partisan!
</p>
<p>
My Florence! well mayst thou contented be<br>
    With this digression, which concerns thee not,<br>
    Thanks to thy people who such forethought take!
</p>
<p>
Many at heart have justice, but shoot slowly,<br>
    That unadvised they come not to the bow,<br>
    But on their very lips thy people have it!
</p>
<p>
Many refuse to bear the common burden;<br>
    But thy solicitous people answereth<br>
    Without being asked, and crieth: “I submit.”
</p>
<p>
Now be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;<br>
    Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom!<br>
    If I speak true, the event conceals it not.
</p>
<p>
Athens and Lacedaemon, they who made<br>
    The ancient laws, and were so civilized,<br>
    Made towards living well a little sign
</p>
<p>
Compared with thee, who makest such fine-spun<br>
    Provisions, that to middle of November<br>
    Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.
</p>
<p>
How oft, within the time of thy remembrance,<br>
    Laws, money, offices, and usages<br>
    Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?
</p>
<p>
And if thou mind thee well, and see the light,<br>
    Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman,<br>
    Who cannot find repose upon her down,
</p>
<p>
But by her tossing wardeth off her pain.

<p>
After the gracious and glad salutations<br>
    Had three and four times been reiterated,<br>
    Sordello backward drew and said, “Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Or ever to this mountain were directed<br>
    The souls deserving to ascend to God,<br>
    My bones were buried by Octavian.
</p>
<p>
I am Virgilius; and for no crime else<br>
    Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;”<br>
    In this wise then my Leader made reply.
</p>
<p>
As one who suddenly before him sees<br>
    Something whereat he marvels, who believes<br>
    And yet does not, saying, “It is! it is not!”
</p>
<p>
So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,<br>
    And with humility returned towards him,<br>
    And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.
</p>
<p>
“O glory of the Latians, thou,” he said,<br>
    “Through whom our language showed what it could do<br>
    O pride eternal of the place I came from,
</p>
<p>
What merit or what grace to me reveals thee?<br>
    If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me<br>
    If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.”
</p>
<p>
“Through all the circles of the doleful realm,”<br>
    Responded he, “have I come hitherward;<br>
    Heaven’s power impelled me, and with that I come.
</p>
<p>
I by not doing, not by doing, lost<br>
    The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,<br>
    And which too late by me was recognized.
</p>
<p>
A place there is below not sad with torments,<br>
    But darkness only, where the lamentations<br>
    Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.
</p>
<p>
There dwell I with the little innocents<br>
    Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they<br>
    Were from our human sinfulness exempt.
</p>
<p>
There dwell I among those who the three saintly<br>
    Virtues did not put on, and without vice<br>
    The others knew and followed all of them.
</p>
<p>
But if thou know and can, some indication<br>
    Give us by which we may the sooner come<br>
    Where Purgatory has its right beginning.”
</p>
<p>
He answered: “No fixed place has been assigned us;<br>
    ’Tis lawful for me to go up and round;<br>
    So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.
</p>
<p>
But see already how the day declines,<br>
    And to go up by night we are not able;<br>
    Therefore ’tis well to think of some fair sojourn.
</p>
<p>
Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;<br>
    If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,<br>
    And thou shalt know them not without delight.”
</p>
<p>
“How is this?” was the answer; “should one wish<br>
    To mount by night would he prevented be<br>
    By others? or mayhap would not have power?”
</p>
<p>
And on the ground the good Sordello drew<br>
    His finger, saying, “See, this line alone<br>
    Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;
</p>
<p>
Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,<br>
    To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;<br>
    This with the want of power the will perplexes.
</p>
<p>
We might indeed therewith return below,<br>
    And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,<br>
    While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.”
</p>
<p>
Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:<br>
    “Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest<br>
    That we can take delight in tarrying.”
</p>
<p>
Little had we withdrawn us from that place,<br>
    When I perceived the mount was hollowed out<br>
    In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.
</p>
<p>
“Thitherward,” said that shade, “will we repair,<br>
    Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,<br>
    And there for the new day will we await.”
</p>
<p>
’Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path<br>
    Which led us to the margin of that dell,<br>
    Where dies the border more than half away.
</p>
<p>
Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,<br>
    The Indian wood resplendent and serene,<br>
    Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,
</p>
<p>
By herbage and by flowers within that hollow<br>
    Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,<br>
    As by its greater vanquished is the less.
</p>
<p>
Nor in that place had nature painted only,<br>
    But of the sweetness of a thousand odours<br>
    Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.
</p>
<p>
“Salve Regina,” on the green and flowers<br>
    There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,<br>
    Which were not visible outside the valley.
</p>
<p>
“Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,”<br>
    Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,<br>
    “Among them do not wish me to conduct you.
</p>
<p>
Better from off this ledge the acts and faces<br>
    Of all of them will you discriminate,<br>
    Than in the plain below received among them.
</p>
<p>
He who sits highest, and the semblance bears<br>
    Of having what he should have done neglected,<br>
    And to the others’ song moves not his lips,
</p>
<p>
Rudolph the Emperor was, who had the power<br>
    To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,<br>
    So that through others slowly she revives.
</p>
<p>
The other, who in look doth comfort him,<br>
    Governed the region where the water springs,<br>
    The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.
</p>
<p>
His name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes<br>
    Far better he than bearded Winceslaus<br>
    His son, who feeds in luxury and ease.
</p>
<p>
And the small-nosed, who close in council seems<br>
    With him that has an aspect so benign,<br>
    Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;
</p>
<p>
Look there, how he is beating at his breast!<br>
    Behold the other one, who for his cheek<br>
    Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;
</p>
<p>
Father and father-in-law of France’s Pest<br>
    Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,<br>
    And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them.
</p>
<p>
He who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,<br>
    Singing, with that one of the manly nose,<br>
    The cord of every valour wore begirt;
</p>
<p>
And if as King had after him remained<br>
    The stripling who in rear of him is sitting,<br>
    Well had the valour passed from vase to vase,
</p>
<p>
Which cannot of the other heirs be said.<br>
    Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms,<br>
    But none the better heritage possesses.
</p>
<p>
Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches<br>
    The probity of man; and this He wills<br>
    Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.
</p>
<p>
Eke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less<br>
    Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings;<br>
    Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already
</p>
<p>
The plant is as inferior to its seed,<br>
    As more than Beatrice and Margaret<br>
    Costanza boasteth of her husband still.
</p>
<p>
Behold the monarch of the simple life,<br>
    Harry of England, sitting there alone;<br>
    He in his branches has a better issue.
</p>
<p>
He who the lowest on the ground among them<br>
    Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William,<br>
    For whose sake Alessandria and her war
</p>
<p>
Make Monferrat and Canavese weep.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.VIII">
<p>
’Twas now the hour that turneth back desire<br>
    In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,<br>
    The day they’ve said to their sweet friends farewell,
</p>
<p>
And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,<br>
    If he doth hear from far away a bell<br>
    That seemeth to deplore the dying day,
</p>
<p>
When I began to make of no avail<br>
    My hearing, and to watch one of the souls<br>
    Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.
</p>
<p>
It joined and lifted upward both its palms,<br>
    Fixing its eyes upon the orient,<br>
    As if it said to God, “Naught else I care for.”
</p>
<p>
“Te lucis ante” so devoutly issued<br>
    Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,<br>
    It made me issue forth from my own mind.
</p>
<p>
And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,<br>
    Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,<br>
    Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.
</p>
<p>
Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,<br>
    For now indeed so subtile is the veil,<br>
    Surely to penetrate within is easy.
</p>
<p>
I saw that army of the gentle-born<br>
    Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,<br>
    As if in expectation, pale and humble;
</p>
<p>
And from on high come forth and down descend,<br>
    I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,<br>
    Truncated and deprived of their points.
</p>
<p>
Green as the little leaflets just now born<br>
    Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions<br>
    Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.
</p>
<p>
One just above us came to take his station,<br>
    And one descended to the opposite bank,<br>
    So that the people were contained between them.
</p>
<p>
Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;<br>
    But in their faces was the eye bewildered,<br>
    As faculty confounded by excess.
</p>
<p>
“From Mary’s bosom both of them have come,”<br>
    Sordello said, “as guardians of the valley<br>
    Against the serpent, that will come anon.”
</p>
<p>
Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,<br>
    Turned round about, and closely drew myself,<br>
    Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.
</p>
<p>
And once again Sordello: “Now descend we<br>
    ’Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;<br>
    Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.”
</p>
<p>
Only three steps I think that I descended,<br>
    And was below, and saw one who was looking<br>
    Only at me, as if he fain would know me.
</p>
<p>
Already now the air was growing dark,<br>
    But not so that between his eyes and mine<br>
    It did not show what it before locked up.
</p>
<p>
Tow’rds me he moved, and I tow’rds him did move;<br>
    Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,<br>
    When I beheld thee not among the damned!
</p>
<p>
No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;<br>
    Then asked he: “How long is it since thou camest<br>
    O’er the far waters to the mountain’s foot?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” said I to him, “through the dismal places<br>
    I came this morn; and am in the first life,<br>
    Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.”
</p>
<p>
And on the instant my reply was heard,<br>
    He and Sordello both shrank back from me,<br>
    Like people who are suddenly bewildered.
</p>
<p>
One to Virgilius, and the other turned<br>
    To one who sat there, crying, “Up, Currado!<br>
    Come and behold what God in grace has willed!”
</p>
<p>
Then, turned to me: “By that especial grace<br>
    Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals<br>
    His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,
</p>
<p>
When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,<br>
    Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,<br>
    Where answer to the innocent is made.
</p>
<p>
I do not think her mother loves me more,<br>
    Since she has laid aside her wimple white,<br>
    Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.
</p>
<p>
Through her full easily is comprehended<br>
    How long in woman lasts the fire of love,<br>
    If eye or touch do not relight it often.
</p>
<p>
So fair a hatchment will not make for her<br>
    The Viper marshalling the Milanese<br>
    A-field, as would have made Gallura’s Cock.”
</p>
<p>
In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed<br>
    Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal<br>
    Which measurably burneth in the heart.
</p>
<p>
My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,<br>
    Still to that point where slowest are the stars,<br>
    Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.
</p>
<p>
And my Conductor: “Son, what dost thou gaze at<br>
    Up there?”  And I to him: “At those three torches<br>
    With which this hither pole is all on fire.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “The four resplendent stars<br>
    Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,<br>
    And these have mounted up to where those were.”
</p>
<p>
As he was speaking, to himself Sordello<br>
    Drew him, and said, “Lo there our Adversary!”<br>
    And pointed with his finger to look thither.
</p>
<p>
Upon the side on which the little valley<br>
    No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance<br>
    The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.
</p>
<p>
’Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,<br>
    Turning at times its head about, and licking<br>
    Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.
</p>
<p>
I did not see, and therefore cannot say<br>
    How the celestial falcons ’gan to move,<br>
    But well I saw that they were both in motion.
</p>
<p>
Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,<br>
    The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,<br>
    Up to their stations flying back alike.
</p>
<p>
The shade that to the Judge had near approached<br>
    When he had called, throughout that whole assault<br>
    Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.
</p>
<p>
“So may the light that leadeth thee on high<br>
    Find in thine own free-will as much of wax<br>
    As needful is up to the highest azure,”
</p>
<p>
Began it, “if some true intelligence<br>
    Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood<br>
    Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.
</p>
<p>
Currado Malaspina was I called;<br>
    I’m not the elder, but from him descended;<br>
    To mine I bore the love which here refineth.”
</p>
<p>
“O,” said I unto him, “through your domains<br>
    I never passed, but where is there a dwelling<br>
    Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?
</p>
<p>
That fame, which doeth honour to your house,<br>
    Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,<br>
    So that he knows of them who ne’er was there.
</p>
<p>
And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you<br>
    Your honoured family in naught abates<br>
    The glory of the purse and of the sword.
</p>
<p>
It is so privileged by use and nature,<br>
    That though a guilty head misguide the world,<br>
    Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.”
</p>
<p>
And he: “Now go; for the sun shall not lie<br>
    Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram<br>
    With all his four feet covers and bestrides,
</p>
<p>
Before that such a courteous opinion<br>
    Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed<br>
    With greater nails than of another’s speech,
</p>
<p>
Unless the course of justice standeth still.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.IX">
<p>
The concubine of old Tithonus now<br>
    Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,<br>
    Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;
</p>
<p>
With gems her forehead all relucent was,<br>
    Set in the shape of that cold animal<br>
    Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,
</p>
<p>
And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night<br>
    Had taken two in that place where we were,<br>
    And now the third was bending down its wings;
</p>
<p>
When I, who something had of Adam in me,<br>
    Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,<br>
    There were all five of us already sat.
</p>
<p>
Just at the hour when her sad lay begins<br>
    The little swallow, near unto the morning,<br>
    Perchance in memory of her former woes,
</p>
<p>
And when the mind of man, a wanderer<br>
    More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,<br>
    Almost prophetic in its visions is,
</p>
<p>
In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended<br>
    An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,<br>
    With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,
</p>
<p>
And this, it seemed to me, was where had been<br>
    By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,<br>
    When to the high consistory he was rapt.
</p>
<p>
I thought within myself, perchance he strikes<br>
    From habit only here, and from elsewhere<br>
    Disdains to bear up any in his feet.
</p>
<p>
Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,<br>
    Terrible as the lightning he descended,<br>
    And snatched me upward even to the fire.
</p>
<p>
Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,<br>
    And the imagined fire did scorch me so,<br>
    That of necessity my sleep was broken.
</p>
<p>
Not otherwise Achilles started up,<br>
    Around him turning his awakened eyes,<br>
    And knowing not the place in which he was,
</p>
<p>
What time from Chiron stealthily his mother<br>
    Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,<br>
    Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,
</p>
<p>
Than I upstarted, when from off my face<br>
    Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,<br>
    As doth the man who freezes with affright.
</p>
<p>
Only my Comforter was at my side,<br>
    And now the sun was more than two hours high,<br>
    And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.
</p>
<p>
“Be not intimidated,” said my Lord,<br>
    “Be reassured, for all is well with us;<br>
    Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.
</p>
<p>
Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;<br>
    See there the cliff that closes it around;<br>
    See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.
</p>
<p>
Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,<br>
    When inwardly thy spirit was asleep<br>
    Upon the flowers that deck the land below,
</p>
<p>
There came a Lady and said: ‘I am Lucia;<br>
    Let me take this one up, who is asleep;<br>
    So will I make his journey easier for him.’
</p>
<p>
Sordello and the other noble shapes<br>
    Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,<br>
    Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.
</p>
<p>
She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes<br>
    That open entrance pointed out to me;<br>
    Then she and sleep together went away.”
</p>
<p>
In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,<br>
    And who to confidence his fear doth change,<br>
    After the truth has been discovered to him,
</p>
<p>
So did I change; and when without disquiet<br>
    My Leader saw me, up along the cliff<br>
    He moved, and I behind him, tow’rd the height.
</p>
<p>
Reader, thou seest well how I exalt<br>
    My theme, and therefore if with greater art<br>
    I fortify it, marvel not thereat.
</p>
<p>
Nearer approached we, and were in such place,<br>
    That there, where first appeared to me a rift<br>
    Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,
</p>
<p>
I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,<br>
    Diverse in colour, to go up to it,<br>
    And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.
</p>
<p>
And as I opened more and more mine eyes,<br>
    I saw him seated on the highest stair,<br>
    Such in the face that I endured it not.
</p>
<p>
And in his hand he had a naked sword,<br>
    Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow’rds us,<br>
    That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Tell it from where you are, what is’t you wish?”<br>
    Began he to exclaim; “where is the escort?<br>
    Take heed your coming hither harm you not!”
</p>
<p>
“A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,”<br>
    My Master answered him, “but even now<br>
    Said to us, ‘Thither go; there is the portal.’”
</p>
<p>
“And may she speed your footsteps in all good,”<br>
    Again began the courteous janitor;<br>
    “Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.”
</p>
<p>
Thither did we approach; and the first stair<br>
    Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,<br>
    I mirrored myself therein as I appear.
</p>
<p>
The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<br>
    Was of a calcined and uneven stone,<br>
    Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.
</p>
<p>
The third, that uppermost rests massively,<br>
    Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red<br>
    As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.
</p>
<p>
Both of his feet was holding upon this<br>
    The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,<br>
    Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.
</p>
<p>
Along the three stairs upward with good will<br>
    Did my Conductor draw me, saying: “Ask<br>
    Humbly that he the fastening may undo.”
</p>
<p>
Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,<br>
    For mercy’s sake besought that he would open,<br>
    But first upon my breast three times I smote.
</p>
<p>
Seven P’s upon my forehead he described<br>
    With the sword’s point, and, “Take heed that thou wash<br>
    These wounds, when thou shalt be within,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,<br>
    Of the same colour were with his attire,<br>
    And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.
</p>
<p>
One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<br>
    First with the white, and after with the yellow,<br>
    Plied he the door, so that I was content.
</p>
<p>
“Whenever faileth either of these keys<br>
    So that it turn not rightly in the lock,”<br>
    He said to us, “this entrance doth not open.
</p>
<p>
More precious one is, but the other needs<br>
    More art and intellect ere it unlock,<br>
    For it is that which doth the knot unloose.
</p>
<p>
From Peter I have them; and he bade me err<br>
    Rather in opening than in keeping shut,<br>
    If people but fall down before my feet.”
</p>
<p>
Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,<br>
    Exclaiming: “Enter; but I give you warning<br>
    That forth returns whoever looks behind.”
</p>
<p>
And when upon their hinges were turned round<br>
    The swivels of that consecrated gate,<br>
    Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,
</p>
<p>
Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed<br>
    Tarpeia, when was ta’en from it the good<br>
    Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.
</p>
<p>
At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,<br>
    And “Te Deum laudamus” seemed to hear<br>
    In voices mingled with sweet melody.
</p>
<p>
Exactly such an image rendered me<br>
    That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,<br>
    When people singing with the organ stand;
</p>
<p>
For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.X">
<p>
When we had crossed the threshold of the door<br>
    Which the perverted love of souls disuses,<br>
    Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,
</p>
<p>
Re-echoing I heard it closed again;<br>
    And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,<br>
    What for my failing had been fit excuse?
</p>
<p>
We mounted upward through a rifted rock,<br>
    Which undulated to this side and that,<br>
    Even as a wave receding and advancing.
</p>
<p>
“Here it behoves us use a little art,”<br>
    Began my Leader, “to adapt ourselves<br>
    Now here, now there, to the receding side.”
</p>
<p>
And this our footsteps so infrequent made,<br>
    That sooner had the moon’s decreasing disk<br>
    Regained its bed to sink again to rest,
</p>
<p>
Than we were forth from out that needle’s eye;<br>
    But when we free and in the open were,<br>
    There where the mountain backward piles itself,
</p>
<p>
I wearied out, and both of us uncertain<br>
    About our way, we stopped upon a plain<br>
    More desolate than roads across the deserts.
</p>
<p>
From where its margin borders on the void,<br>
    To foot of the high bank that ever rises,<br>
    A human body three times told would measure;
</p>
<p>
And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,<br>
    Now on the left, and on the right flank now,<br>
    The same this cornice did appear to me.
</p>
<p>
Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,<br>
    When I perceived the embankment round about,<br>
    Which all right of ascent had interdicted,
</p>
<p>
To be of marble white, and so adorned<br>
    With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,<br>
    But Nature’s self, had there been put to shame.
</p>
<p>
The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings<br>
    Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,<br>
    And opened Heaven from its long interdict,
</p>
<p>
In front of us appeared so truthfully<br>
    There sculptured in a gracious attitude,<br>
    He did not seem an image that is silent.
</p>
<p>
One would have sworn that he was saying, “Ave;”<br>
    For she was there in effigy portrayed<br>
    Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,
</p>
<p>
And in her mien this language had impressed,<br>
    “Ecce ancilla Dei,” as distinctly<br>
    As any figure stamps itself in wax.
</p>
<p>
“Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,”<br>
    The gentle Master said, who had me standing<br>
    Upon that side where people have their hearts;
</p>
<p>
Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld<br>
    In rear of Mary, and upon that side<br>
    Where he was standing who conducted me,
</p>
<p>
Another story on the rock imposed;<br>
    Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,<br>
    So that before mine eyes it might be set.
</p>
<p>
There sculptured in the self-same marble were<br>
    The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,<br>
    Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.
</p>
<p>
People appeared in front, and all of them<br>
    In seven choirs divided, of two senses<br>
    Made one say “No,” the other, “Yes, they sing.”
</p>
<p>
Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,<br>
    Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose<br>
    Were in the yes and no discordant made.
</p>
<p>
Preceded there the vessel benedight,<br>
    Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,<br>
    And more and less than King was he in this.
</p>
<p>
Opposite, represented at the window<br>
    Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,<br>
    Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.
</p>
<p>
I moved my feet from where I had been standing,<br>
    To examine near at hand another story,<br>
    Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.
</p>
<p>
There the high glory of the Roman Prince<br>
    Was chronicled, whose great beneficence<br>
    Moved Gregory to his great victory;
</p>
<p>
’Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;<br>
    And a poor widow at his bridle stood,<br>
    In attitude of weeping and of grief.
</p>
<p>
Around about him seemed it thronged and full<br>
    Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold<br>
    Above them visibly in the wind were moving.
</p>
<p>
The wretched woman in the midst of these<br>
    Seemed to be saying: “Give me vengeance, Lord,<br>
    For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.”
</p>
<p>
And he to answer her: “Now wait until<br>
    I shall return.”  And she: “My Lord,” like one<br>
    In whom grief is impatient, “shouldst thou not
</p>
<p>
Return?”  And he: “Who shall be where I am<br>
    Will give it thee.”  And she: “Good deed of others<br>
    What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?”
</p>
<p>
Whence he: “Now comfort thee, for it behoves me<br>
    That I discharge my duty ere I move;<br>
    Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.”
</p>
<p>
He who on no new thing has ever looked<br>
    Was the creator of this visible language,<br>
    Novel to us, for here it is not found.
</p>
<p>
While I delighted me in contemplating<br>
    The images of such humility,<br>
    And dear to look on for their Maker’s sake,
</p>
<p>
“Behold, upon this side, but rare they make<br>
    Their steps,” the Poet murmured, “many people;<br>
    These will direct us to the lofty stairs.”
</p>
<p>
Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent<br>
    To see new things, of which they curious are,<br>
    In turning round towards him were not slow.
</p>
<p>
But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve<br>
    From thy good purposes, because thou hearest<br>
    How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;
</p>
<p>
Attend not to the fashion of the torment,<br>
    Think of what follows; think that at the worst<br>
    It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.
</p>
<p>
“Master,” began I, “that which I behold<br>
    Moving towards us seems to me not persons,<br>
    And what I know not, so in sight I waver.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “The grievous quality<br>
    Of this their torment bows them so to earth,<br>
    That my own eyes at first contended with it;
</p>
<p>
But look there fixedly, and disentangle<br>
    By sight what cometh underneath those stones;<br>
    Already canst thou see how each is stricken.”
</p>
<p>
O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!<br>
    Who, in the vision of the mind infirm<br>
    Confidence have in your backsliding steps,
</p>
<p>
Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,<br>
    Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly<br>
    That flieth unto judgment without screen?
</p>
<p>
Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?<br>
    Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,<br>
    Even as the worm in whom formation fails!
</p>
<p>
As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,<br>
    In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure<br>
    Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,
</p>
<p>
Which makes of the unreal real anguish<br>
    Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus<br>
    Beheld I those, when I had ta’en good heed.
</p>
<p>
True is it, they were more or less bent down,<br>
    According as they more or less were laden;<br>
    And he who had most patience in his looks
</p>
<p>
Weeping did seem to say, “I can no more!”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XI">
<p>
“Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,<br>
    Not circumscribed, but from the greater love<br>
    Thou bearest to the first effects on high,
</p>
<p>
Praised be thy name and thine omnipotence<br>
    By every creature, as befitting is<br>
    To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.
</p>
<p>
Come unto us the peace of thy dominion,<br>
    For unto it we cannot of ourselves,<br>
    If it come not, with all our intellect.
</p>
<p>
Even as thine own Angels of their will<br>
    Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,<br>
    So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.
</p>
<p>
Give unto us this day our daily manna,<br>
    Withouten which in this rough wilderness<br>
    Backward goes he who toils most to advance.
</p>
<p>
And even as we the trespass we have suffered<br>
    Pardon in one another, pardon thou<br>
    Benignly, and regard not our desert.
</p>
<p>
Our virtue, which is easily o’ercome,<br>
    Put not to proof with the old Adversary,<br>
    But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.
</p>
<p>
This last petition verily, dear Lord,<br>
    Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,<br>
    But for their sake who have remained behind us.”
</p>
<p>
Thus for themselves and us good furtherance<br>
    Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight<br>
    Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,
</p>
<p>
Unequally in anguish round and round<br>
    And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,<br>
    Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.
</p>
<p>
If there good words are always said for us,<br>
    What may not here be said and done for them,<br>
    By those who have a good root to their will?
</p>
<p>
Well may we help them wash away the marks<br>
    That hence they carried, so that clean and light<br>
    They may ascend unto the starry wheels!
</p>
<p>
“Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden<br>
    Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,<br>
    That shall uplift you after your desire,
</p>
<p>
Show us on which hand tow’rd the stairs the way<br>
    Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,<br>
    Point us out that which least abruptly falls;
</p>
<p>
For he who cometh with me, through the burden<br>
    Of Adam’s flesh wherewith he is invested,<br>
    Against his will is chary of his climbing.”
</p>
<p>
The words of theirs which they returned to those<br>
    That he whom I was following had spoken,<br>
    It was not manifest from whom they came,
</p>
<p>
But it was said: “To the right hand come with us<br>
    Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass<br>
    Possible for living person to ascend.
</p>
<p>
And were I not impeded by the stone,<br>
    Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,<br>
    Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,
</p>
<p>
Him, who still lives and does not name himself,<br>
    Would I regard, to see if I may know him<br>
    And make him piteous unto this burden.
</p>
<p>
A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;<br>
    Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;<br>
    I know not if his name were ever with you.
</p>
<p>
The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry<br>
    Of my progenitors so arrogant made me<br>
    That, thinking not upon the common mother,
</p>
<p>
All men I held in scorn to such extent<br>
    I died therefor, as know the Sienese,<br>
    And every child in Campagnatico.
</p>
<p>
I am Omberto; and not to me alone<br>
    Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin<br>
    Has with it dragged into adversity.
</p>
<p>
And here must I this burden bear for it<br>
    Till God be satisfied, since I did not<br>
    Among the living, here among the dead.”
</p>
<p>
Listening I downward bent my countenance;<br>
    And one of them, not this one who was speaking,<br>
    Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,
</p>
<p>
And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,<br>
    Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed<br>
    On me, who all bowed down was going with them.
</p>
<p>
“O,” asked I him, “art thou not Oderisi,<br>
    Agobbio’s honour, and honour of that art<br>
    Which is in Paris called illuminating?”
</p>
<p>
“Brother,” said he, “more laughing are the leaves<br>
    Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;<br>
    All his the honour now, and mine in part.
</p>
<p>
In sooth I had not been so courteous<br>
    While I was living, for the great desire<br>
    Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.
</p>
<p>
Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;<br>
    And yet I should not be here, were it not<br>
    That, having power to sin, I turned to God.
</p>
<p>
O thou vain glory of the human powers,<br>
    How little green upon thy summit lingers,<br>
    If’t be not followed by an age of grossness!
</p>
<p>
In painting Cimabue thought that he<br>
    Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,<br>
    So that the other’s fame is growing dim.
</p>
<p>
So has one Guido from the other taken<br>
    The glory of our tongue, and he perchance<br>
    Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.
</p>
<p>
Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath<br>
    Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,<br>
    And changes name, because it changes side.
</p>
<p>
What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off<br>
    From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead<br>
    Before thou left the ‘pappo’ and the ‘dindi,’
</p>
<p>
Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter<br>
    Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye<br>
    Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.
</p>
<p>
With him, who takes so little of the road<br>
    In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;<br>
    And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,
</p>
<p>
Where he was lord, what time was overthrown<br>
    The Florentine delirium, that superb<br>
    Was at that day as now ’tis prostitute.
</p>
<p>
Your reputation is the colour of grass<br>
    Which comes and goes, and that discolours it<br>
    By which it issues green from out the earth.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “Thy true speech fills my heart with good<br>
    Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;<br>
    But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?”
</p>
<p>
“That,” he replied, “is Provenzan Salvani,<br>
    And he is here because he had presumed<br>
    To bring Siena all into his hands.
</p>
<p>
He has gone thus, and goeth without rest<br>
    E’er since he died; such money renders back<br>
    In payment he who is on earth too daring.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “If every spirit who awaits<br>
    The verge of life before that he repent,<br>
    Remains below there and ascends not hither,
</p>
<p>
(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)<br>
    Until as much time as he lived be passed,<br>
    How was the coming granted him in largess?”
</p>
<p>
“When he in greatest splendour lived,” said he,<br>
    “Freely upon the Campo of Siena,<br>
    All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;
</p>
<p>
And there to draw his friend from the duress<br>
    Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,<br>
    He brought himself to tremble in each vein.
</p>
<p>
I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;<br>
    Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours<br>
    Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.
</p>
<p>
This action has released him from those confines.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XII">
<p>
Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,<br>
    I with that heavy-laden soul went on,<br>
    As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;
</p>
<p>
But when he said, “Leave him, and onward pass,<br>
    For here ’tis good that with the sail and oars,<br>
    As much as may be, each push on his barque;”
</p>
<p>
Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed<br>
    My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts<br>
    Remained within me downcast and abashed.
</p>
<p>
I had moved on, and followed willingly<br>
    The footsteps of my Master, and we both<br>
    Already showed how light of foot we were,
</p>
<p>
When unto me he said: “Cast down thine eyes;<br>
    ’Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,<br>
    To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.”
</p>
<p>
As, that some memory may exist of them,<br>
    Above the buried dead their tombs in earth<br>
    Bear sculptured on them what they were before;
</p>
<p>
Whence often there we weep for them afresh,<br>
    From pricking of remembrance, which alone<br>
    To the compassionate doth set its spur;
</p>
<p>
So saw I there, but of a better semblance<br>
    In point of artifice, with figures covered<br>
    Whate’er as pathway from the mount projects.
</p>
<p>
I saw that one who was created noble<br>
    More than all other creatures, down from heaven<br>
    Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.
</p>
<p>
I saw Briareus smitten by the dart<br>
    Celestial, lying on the other side,<br>
    Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.
</p>
<p>
I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,<br>
    Still clad in armour round about their father,<br>
    Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.
</p>
<p>
I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,<br>
    As if bewildered, looking at the people<br>
    Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.
</p>
<p>
O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes<br>
    Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,<br>
    Between thy seven and seven children slain!
</p>
<p>
O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword<br>
    Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,<br>
    That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!
</p>
<p>
O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld<br>
    E’en then half spider, sad upon the shreds<br>
    Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!
</p>
<p>
O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten<br>
    Thine image there; but full of consternation<br>
    A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!
</p>
<p>
Displayed moreo’er the adamantine pavement<br>
    How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon<br>
    Costly appear the luckless ornament;
</p>
<p>
Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves<br>
    Upon Sennacherib within the temple,<br>
    And how, he being dead, they left him there;
</p>
<p>
Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage<br>
    That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,<br>
    “Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!”
</p>
<p>
Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians<br>
    After that Holofernes had been slain,<br>
    And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.
</p>
<p>
I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;<br>
    O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,<br>
    Displayed the image that is there discerned!
</p>
<p>
Whoe’er of pencil master was or stile,<br>
    That could portray the shades and traits which there<br>
    Would cause each subtile genius to admire?
</p>
<p>
Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;<br>
    Better than I saw not who saw the truth,<br>
    All that I trod upon while bowed I went.
</p>
<p>
Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,<br>
    Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces<br>
    So that ye may behold your evil ways!
</p>
<p>
More of the mount by us was now encompassed,<br>
    And far more spent the circuit of the sun,<br>
    Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,
</p>
<p>
When he, who ever watchful in advance<br>
    Was going on, began: “Lift up thy head,<br>
    ’Tis no more time to go thus meditating.
</p>
<p>
Lo there an Angel who is making haste<br>
    To come towards us; lo, returning is<br>
    From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.
</p>
<p>
With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,<br>
    So that he may delight to speed us upward;<br>
    Think that this day will never dawn again.”
</p>
<p>
I was familiar with his admonition<br>
    Ever to lose no time; so on this theme<br>
    He could not unto me speak covertly.
</p>
<p>
Towards us came the being beautiful<br>
    Vested in white, and in his countenance<br>
    Such as appears the tremulous morning star.
</p>
<p>
His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;<br>
    “Come,” said he, “near at hand here are the steps,<br>
    And easy from henceforth is the ascent.”
</p>
<p>
At this announcement few are they who come!<br>
    O human creatures, born to soar aloft,<br>
    Why fall ye thus before a little wind?
</p>
<p>
He led us on to where the rock was cleft;<br>
    There smote upon my forehead with his wings,<br>
    Then a safe passage promised unto me.
</p>
<p>
As on the right hand, to ascend the mount<br>
    Where seated is the church that lordeth it<br>
    O’er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,
</p>
<p>
The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken<br>
    By stairways that were made there in the age<br>
    When still were safe the ledger and the stave,
</p>
<p>
E’en thus attempered is the bank which falls<br>
    Sheer downward from the second circle there;<br>
    But on this, side and that the high rock graze.
</p>
<p>
As we were turning thitherward our persons,<br>
    “Beati pauperes spiritu,” voices<br>
    Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.
</p>
<p>
Ah me! how different are these entrances<br>
    From the Infernal! for with anthems here<br>
    One enters, and below with wild laments.
</p>
<p>
We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,<br>
    And it appeared to me by far more easy<br>
    Than on the plain it had appeared before.
</p>
<p>
Whence I: “My Master, say, what heavy thing<br>
    Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly<br>
    Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?”
</p>
<p>
He answered: “When the P’s which have remained<br>
    Still on thy face almost obliterate<br>
    Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,
</p>
<p>
Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,<br>
    That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,<br>
    But urging up will be to them delight.”
</p>
<p>
Then did I even as they do who are going<br>
    With something on the head to them unknown,<br>
    Unless the signs of others make them doubt,
</p>
<p>
Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,<br>
    And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office<br>
    Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;
</p>
<p>
And with the fingers of the right hand spread<br>
    I found but six the letters, that had carved<br>
    Upon my temples he who bore the keys;
</p>
<p>
Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XIII">
<p>
We were upon the summit of the stairs,<br>
    Where for the second time is cut away<br>
    The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.
</p>
<p>
There in like manner doth a cornice bind<br>
    The hill all round about, as does the first,<br>
    Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.
</p>
<p>
Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;<br>
    So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,<br>
    With but the livid colour of the stone.
</p>
<p>
“If to inquire we wait for people here,”<br>
    The Poet said, “I fear that peradventure<br>
    Too much delay will our election have.”
</p>
<p>
Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,<br>
    Made his right side the centre of his motion,<br>
    And turned the left part of himself about.
</p>
<p>
“O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<br>
    Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,”<br>
    Said he, “as one within here should be led.
</p>
<p>
Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;<br>
    If other reason prompt not otherwise,<br>
    Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!”
</p>
<p>
As much as here is counted for a mile,<br>
    So much already there had we advanced<br>
    In little time, by dint of ready will;
</p>
<p>
And tow’rds us there were heard to fly, albeit<br>
    They were not visible, spirits uttering<br>
    Unto Love’s table courteous invitations,
</p>
<p>
The first voice that passed onward in its flight,<br>
    “Vinum non habent,” said in accents loud,<br>
    And went reiterating it behind us.
</p>
<p>
And ere it wholly grew inaudible<br>
    Because of distance, passed another, crying,<br>
    “I am Orestes!” and it also stayed not.
</p>
<p>
“O,” said I, “Father, these, what voices are they?”<br>
    And even as I asked, behold the third,<br>
    Saying: “Love those from whom ye have had evil!”
</p>
<p>
And the good Master said: “This circle scourges<br>
    The sin of envy, and on that account<br>
    Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.
</p>
<p>
The bridle of another sound shall be;<br>
    I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,<br>
    Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.
</p>
<p>
But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,<br>
    And people thou wilt see before us sitting,<br>
    And each one close against the cliff is seated.”
</p>
<p>
Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;<br>
    I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles<br>
    Not from the colour of the stone diverse.
</p>
<p>
And when we were a little farther onward,<br>
    I heard a cry of, “Mary, pray for us!”<br>
    A cry of, “Michael, Peter, and all Saints!”
</p>
<p>
I do not think there walketh still on earth<br>
    A man so hard, that he would not be pierced<br>
    With pity at what afterward I saw.
</p>
<p>
For when I had approached so near to them<br>
    That manifest to me their acts became,<br>
    Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.
</p>
<p>
Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,<br>
    And one sustained the other with his shoulder,<br>
    And all of them were by the bank sustained.
</p>
<p>
Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,<br>
    Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,<br>
    And one upon another leans his head,
</p>
<p>
So that in others pity soon may rise,<br>
    Not only at the accent of their words,<br>
    But at their aspect, which no less implores.
</p>
<p>
And as unto the blind the sun comes not,<br>
    So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,<br>
    Heaven’s light will not be bounteous of itself;
</p>
<p>
For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,<br>
    And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild<br>
    Is done, because it will not quiet stay.
</p>
<p>
To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,<br>
    Seeing the others without being seen;<br>
    Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.
</p>
<p>
Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,<br>
    And therefore waited not for my demand,<br>
    But said: “Speak, and be brief, and to the point.”
</p>
<p>
I had Virgilius upon that side<br>
    Of the embankment from which one may fall,<br>
    Since by no border ’tis engarlanded;
</p>
<p>
Upon the other side of me I had<br>
    The shades devout, who through the horrible seam<br>
    Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.
</p>
<p>
To them I turned me, and, “O people, certain,”<br>
    Began I, “of beholding the high light,<br>
    Which your desire has solely in its care,
</p>
<p>
So may grace speedily dissolve the scum<br>
    Upon your consciences, that limpidly<br>
    Through them descend the river of the mind,
</p>
<p>
Tell me, for dear ’twill be to me and gracious,<br>
    If any soul among you here is Latian,<br>
    And ’twill perchance be good for him I learn it.”
</p>
<p>
“O brother mine, each one is citizen<br>
    Of one true city; but thy meaning is,<br>
    Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.”
</p>
<p>
By way of answer this I seemed to hear<br>
    A little farther on than where I stood,<br>
    Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.
</p>
<p>
Among the rest I saw a shade that waited<br>
    In aspect, and should any one ask how,<br>
    Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.
</p>
<p>
“Spirit,” I said, “who stoopest to ascend,<br>
    If thou art he who did reply to me,<br>
    Make thyself known to me by place or name.”
</p>
<p>
“Sienese was I,” it replied, “and with<br>
    The others here recleanse my guilty life,<br>
    Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.
</p>
<p>
Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<br>
    Was called, and I was at another’s harm<br>
    More happy far than at my own good fortune.
</p>
<p>
And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,<br>
    Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.<br>
    The arc already of my years descending,
</p>
<p>
My fellow-citizens near unto Colle<br>
    Were joined in battle with their adversaries,<br>
    And I was praying God for what he willed.
</p>
<p>
Routed were they, and turned into the bitter<br>
    Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,<br>
    A joy received unequalled by all others;
</p>
<p>
So that I lifted upward my bold face<br>
    Crying to God, ‘Henceforth I fear thee not,’<br>
    As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.
</p>
<p>
Peace I desired with God at the extreme<br>
    Of my existence, and as yet would not<br>
    My debt have been by penitence discharged,
</p>
<p>
Had it not been that in remembrance held me<br>
    Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<br>
    Who out of charity was grieved for me.
</p>
<p>
But who art thou, that into our conditions<br>
    Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound<br>
    As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?”
</p>
<p>
“Mine eyes,” I said, “will yet be here ta’en from me,<br>
    But for short space; for small is the offence<br>
    Committed by their being turned with envy.
</p>
<p>
Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended<br>
    My soul is, of the torment underneath,<br>
    For even now the load down there weighs on me.”
</p>
<p>
And she to me: “Who led thee, then, among us<br>
    Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?”<br>
    And I: “He who is with me, and speaks not;
</p>
<p>
And living am I; therefore ask of me,<br>
    Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move<br>
    O’er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.”
</p>
<p>
“O, this is such a novel thing to hear,”<br>
    She answered, “that great sign it is God loves thee;<br>
    Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.
</p>
<p>
And I implore, by what thou most desirest,<br>
    If e’er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,<br>
    Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.
</p>
<p>
Them wilt thou see among that people vain<br>
    Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there<br>
    More hope than in discovering the Diana;
</p>
<p>
But there still more the admirals will lose.”
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XIV">
<p>
“Who is this one that goes about our mountain,<br>
    Or ever Death has given him power of flight,<br>
    And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?”
</p>
<p>
“I know not who, but know he’s not alone;<br>
    Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,<br>
    And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.”
</p>
<p>
Thus did two spirits, leaning tow’rds each other,<br>
    Discourse about me there on the right hand;<br>
    Then held supine their faces to address me.
</p>
<p>
And said the one: “O soul, that, fastened still<br>
    Within the body, tow’rds the heaven art going,<br>
    For charity console us, and declare
</p>
<p>
Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak’st us<br>
    As much to marvel at this grace of thine<br>
    As must a thing that never yet has been.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “Through midst of Tuscany there wanders<br>
    A streamlet that is born in Falterona,<br>
    And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;
</p>
<p>
From thereupon do I this body bring.<br>
    To tell you who I am were speech in vain,<br>
    Because my name as yet makes no great noise.”
</p>
<p>
“If well thy meaning I can penetrate<br>
    With intellect of mine,” then answered me<br>
    He who first spake, “thou speakest of the Arno.”
</p>
<p>
And said the other to him: “Why concealed<br>
    This one the appellation of that river,<br>
    Even as a man doth of things horrible?”
</p>
<p>
And thus the shade that questioned was of this<br>
    Himself acquitted: “I know not; but truly<br>
    ’Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;
</p>
<p>
For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant<br>
    The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro<br>
    That in few places it that mark surpasses)
</p>
<p>
To where it yields itself in restoration<br>
    Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,<br>
    Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,
</p>
<p>
Virtue is like an enemy avoided<br>
    By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune<br>
    Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;
</p>
<p>
On which account have so transformed their nature<br>
    The dwellers in that miserable valley,<br>
    It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.
</p>
<p>
’Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier<br>
    Than other food for human use created,<br>
    It first directeth its impoverished way.
</p>
<p>
Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,<br>
    More snarling than their puissance demands,<br>
    And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.
</p>
<p>
It goes on falling, and the more it grows,<br>
    The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,<br>
    This maledict and misadventurous ditch.
</p>
<p>
Descended then through many a hollow gulf,<br>
    It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,<br>
    They fear no cunning that may master them.
</p>
<p>
Nor will I cease because another hears me;<br>
    And well ’twill be for him, if still he mind him<br>
    Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.
</p>
<p>
Thy grandson I behold, who doth become<br>
    A hunter of those wolves upon the bank<br>
    Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.
</p>
<p>
He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;<br>
    Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;<br>
    Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.
</p>
<p>
Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;<br>
    He leaves it such, a thousand years from now<br>
    In its primeval state ’tis not re-wooded.”
</p>
<p>
As at the announcement of impending ills<br>
    The face of him who listens is disturbed,<br>
    From whate’er side the peril seize upon him;
</p>
<p>
So I beheld that other soul, which stood<br>
    Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,<br>
    When it had gathered to itself the word.
</p>
<p>
The speech of one and aspect of the other<br>
    Had me desirous made to know their names,<br>
    And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,
</p>
<p>
Whereat the spirit which first spake to me<br>
    Began again: “Thou wishest I should bring me<br>
    To do for thee what thou’lt not do for me;
</p>
<p>
But since God willeth that in thee shine forth<br>
    Such grace of his, I’ll not be chary with thee;<br>
    Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.
</p>
<p>
My blood was so with envy set on fire,<br>
    That if I had beheld a man make merry,<br>
    Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o’er with pallor.
</p>
<p>
From my own sowing such the straw I reap!<br>
    O human race! why dost thou set thy heart<br>
    Where interdict of partnership must be?
</p>
<p>
This is Renier; this is the boast and honour<br>
    Of the house of Calboli, where no one since<br>
    Has made himself the heir of his desert.
</p>
<p>
And not alone his blood is made devoid,<br>
    ’Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,<br>
    Of good required for truth and for diversion;
</p>
<p>
For all within these boundaries is full<br>
    Of venomous roots, so that too tardily<br>
    By cultivation now would they diminish.
</p>
<p>
Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,<br>
    Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,<br>
    O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?
</p>
<p>
When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?<br>
    When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,<br>
    The noble scion of ignoble seed?
</p>
<p>
Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,<br>
    When I remember, with Guido da Prata,<br>
    Ugolin d’ Azzo, who was living with us,
</p>
<p>
Frederick Tignoso and his company,<br>
    The house of Traversara, and th’ Anastagi,<br>
    And one race and the other is extinct;
</p>
<p>
The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease<br>
    That filled our souls with love and courtesy,<br>
    There where the hearts have so malicious grown!
</p>
<p>
O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,<br>
    Seeing that all thy family is gone,<br>
    And many people, not to be corrupted?
</p>
<p>
Bagnacaval does well in not begetting<br>
    And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,<br>
    In taking trouble to beget such Counts.
</p>
<p>
Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil<br>
    Shall have departed; but not therefore pure<br>
    Will testimony of them e’er remain.
</p>
<p>
O Ugolin de’ Fantoli, secure<br>
    Thy name is, since no longer is awaited<br>
    One who, degenerating, can obscure it!
</p>
<p>
But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me<br>
    To weep far better than it does to speak,<br>
    So much has our discourse my mind distressed.”
</p>
<p>
We were aware that those beloved souls<br>
    Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,<br>
    They made us of our pathway confident.
</p>
<p>
When we became alone by going onward,<br>
    Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared<br>
    A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:
</p>
<p>
“Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!”<br>
    And fled as the reverberation dies<br>
    If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.
</p>
<p>
As soon as hearing had a truce from this,<br>
    Behold another, with so great a crash,<br>
    That it resembled thunderings following fast:
</p>
<p>
“I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!”<br>
    And then, to press myself close to the Poet,<br>
    I backward, and not forward, took a step.
</p>
<p>
Already on all sides the air was quiet;<br>
    And said he to me: “That was the hard curb<br>
    That ought to hold a man within his bounds;
</p>
<p>
But you take in the bait so that the hook<br>
    Of the old Adversary draws you to him,<br>
    And hence availeth little curb or call.
</p>
<p>
The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,<br>
    Displaying to you their eternal beauties,<br>
    And still your eye is looking on the ground;
</p>
<p>
Whence He, who all discerns, chastises you.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XV">
<p>
As much as ’twixt the close of the third hour<br>
    And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere<br>
    Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,
</p>
<p>
So much it now appeared, towards the night,<br>
    Was of his course remaining to the sun;<br>
    There it was evening, and ’twas midnight here;
</p>
<p>
And the rays smote the middle of our faces,<br>
    Because by us the mount was so encircled,<br>
    That straight towards the west we now were going
</p>
<p>
When I perceived my forehead overpowered<br>
    Beneath the splendour far more than at first,<br>
    And stupor were to me the things unknown,
</p>
<p>
Whereat towards the summit of my brow<br>
    I raised my hands, and made myself the visor<br>
    Which the excessive glare diminishes.
</p>
<p>
As when from off the water, or a mirror,<br>
    The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,<br>
    Ascending upward in the selfsame measure
</p>
<p>
That it descends, and deviates as far<br>
    From falling of a stone in line direct,<br>
    (As demonstrate experiment and art,)
</p>
<p>
So it appeared to me that by a light<br>
    Refracted there before me I was smitten;<br>
    On which account my sight was swift to flee.
</p>
<p>
“What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot<br>
    So fully screen my sight that it avail me,”<br>
    Said I, “and seems towards us to be moving?”
</p>
<p>
“Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet<br>
    The family of heaven,” he answered me;<br>
    “An angel ’tis, who comes to invite us upward.
</p>
<p>
Soon will it be, that to behold these things<br>
    Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee<br>
    As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.”
</p>
<p>
When we had reached the Angel benedight,<br>
    With joyful voice he said: “Here enter in<br>
    To stairway far less steep than are the others.”
</p>
<p>
We mounting were, already thence departed,<br>
    And “Beati misericordes” was<br>
    Behind us sung, “Rejoice, thou that o’ercomest!”
</p>
<p>
My Master and myself, we two alone<br>
    Were going upward, and I thought, in going,<br>
    Some profit to acquire from words of his;
</p>
<p>
And I to him directed me, thus asking:<br>
    “What did the spirit of Romagna mean,<br>
    Mentioning interdict and partnership?”
</p>
<p>
Whence he to me: “Of his own greatest failing<br>
    He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not<br>
    If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.
</p>
<p>
Because are thither pointed your desires<br>
    Where by companionship each share is lessened,<br>
    Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.
</p>
<p>
But if the love of the supernal sphere<br>
    Should upwardly direct your aspiration,<br>
    There would not be that fear within your breast;
</p>
<p>
For there, as much the more as one says ‘Our,’<br>
    So much the more of good each one possesses,<br>
    And more of charity in that cloister burns.”
</p>
<p>
“I am more hungering to be satisfied,”<br>
    I said, “than if I had before been silent,<br>
    And more of doubt within my mind I gather.
</p>
<p>
How can it be, that boon distributed<br>
    The more possessors can more wealthy make<br>
    Therein, than if by few it be possessed?”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Because thou fixest still<br>
    Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,<br>
    Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.
</p>
<p>
That goodness infinite and ineffable<br>
    Which is above there, runneth unto love,<br>
    As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.
</p>
<p>
So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,<br>
    So that as far as charity extends,<br>
    O’er it increases the eternal valour.
</p>
<p>
And the more people thitherward aspire,<br>
    More are there to love well, and more they love there,<br>
    And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.
</p>
<p>
And if my reasoning appease thee not,<br>
    Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully<br>
    Take from thee this and every other longing.
</p>
<p>
Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,<br>
    As are the two already, the five wounds<br>
    That close themselves again by being painful.”
</p>
<p>
Even as I wished to say, “Thou dost appease me,”<br>
    I saw that I had reached another circle,<br>
    So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.
</p>
<p>
There it appeared to me that in a vision<br>
    Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,<br>
    And in a temple many persons saw;
</p>
<p>
And at the door a woman, with the sweet<br>
    Behaviour of a mother, saying: “Son,<br>
    Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?
</p>
<p>
Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself<br>
    Were seeking for thee;”—and as here she ceased,<br>
    That which appeared at first had disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Then I beheld another with those waters<br>
    Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever<br>
    From great disdain of others it is born,
</p>
<p>
And saying: “If of that city thou art lord,<br>
    For whose name was such strife among the gods,<br>
    And whence doth every science scintillate,
</p>
<p>
Avenge thyself on those audacious arms<br>
    That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;”<br>
    And the lord seemed to me benign and mild
</p>
<p>
To answer her with aspect temperate:<br>
    “What shall we do to those who wish us ill,<br>
    If he who loves us be by us condemned?”
</p>
<p>
Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<br>
    With stones a young man slaying, clamorously<br>
    Still crying to each other, “Kill him! kill him!”
</p>
<p>
And him I saw bow down, because of death<br>
    That weighed already on him, to the earth,<br>
    But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,
</p>
<p>
Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,<br>
    That he would pardon those his persecutors,<br>
    With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.
</p>
<p>
Soon as my soul had outwardly returned<br>
    To things external to it which are true,<br>
    Did I my not false errors recognize.
</p>
<p>
My Leader, who could see me bear myself<br>
    Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,<br>
    Exclaimed: “What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?
</p>
<p>
But hast been coming more than half a league<br>
    Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,<br>
    In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?”
</p>
<p>
“O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,<br>
    I’ll tell thee,” said I, “what appeared to me,<br>
    When thus from me my legs were ta’en away.”
</p>
<p>
And he: “If thou shouldst have a hundred masks<br>
    Upon thy face, from me would not be shut<br>
    Thy cogitations, howsoever small.
</p>
<p>
What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail<br>
    To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,<br>
    Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.
</p>
<p>
I did not ask, ‘What ails thee?’ as he does<br>
    Who only looketh with the eyes that see not<br>
    When of the soul bereft the body lies,
</p>
<p>
But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;<br>
    Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow<br>
    To use their wakefulness when it returns.”
</p>
<p>
We passed along, athwart the twilight peering<br>
    Forward as far as ever eye could stretch<br>
    Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;
</p>
<p>
And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached<br>
    In our direction, sombre as the night,<br>
    Nor was there place to hide one’s self therefrom.
</p>
<p>
This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XVI">
<p>
Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<br>
    Of every planet under a poor sky,<br>
    As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,
</p>
<p>
Ne’er made unto my sight so thick a veil,<br>
    As did that smoke which there enveloped us,<br>
    Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;
</p>
<p>
For not an eye it suffered to stay open;<br>
    Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,<br>
    Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
E’en as a blind man goes behind his guide,<br>
    Lest he should wander, or should strike against<br>
    Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,
</p>
<p>
So went I through the bitter and foul air,<br>
    Listening unto my Leader, who said only,<br>
    “Look that from me thou be not separated.”
</p>
<p>
Voices I heard, and every one appeared<br>
    To supplicate for peace and misericord<br>
    The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.
</p>
<p>
Still “Agnus Dei” their exordium was;<br>
    One word there was in all, and metre one,<br>
    So that all harmony appeared among them.
</p>
<p>
“Master,” I said, “are spirits those I hear?”<br>
    And he to me: “Thou apprehendest truly,<br>
    And they the knot of anger go unloosing.”
</p>
<p>
“Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke<br>
    And art discoursing of us even as though<br>
    Thou didst by calends still divide the time?”
</p>
<p>
After this manner by a voice was spoken;<br>
    Whereon my Master said: “Do thou reply,<br>
    And ask if on this side the way go upward.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “O creature that dost cleanse thyself<br>
    To return beautiful to Him who made thee,<br>
    Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.”
</p>
<p>
“Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,”<br>
    He answered; “and if smoke prevent our seeing,<br>
    Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.”
</p>
<p>
Thereon began I: “With that swathing band<br>
    Which death unwindeth am I going upward,<br>
    And hither came I through the infernal anguish.
</p>
<p>
And if God in his grace has me infolded,<br>
    So that he wills that I behold his court<br>
    By method wholly out of modern usage,
</p>
<p>
Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,<br>
    But tell it me, and tell me if I go<br>
    Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.”
</p>
<p>
“Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<br>
    The world I knew, and loved that excellence,<br>
    At which has each one now unbent his bow.
</p>
<p>
For mounting upward, thou art going right.”<br>
    Thus he made answer, and subjoined: “I pray thee<br>
    To pray for me when thou shalt be above.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “My faith I pledge to thee<br>
    To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting<br>
    Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.
</p>
<p>
First it was simple, and is now made double<br>
    By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,<br>
    Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.
</p>
<p>
The world forsooth is utterly deserted<br>
    By every virtue, as thou tellest me,<br>
    And with iniquity is big and covered;
</p>
<p>
But I beseech thee point me out the cause,<br>
    That I may see it, and to others show it;<br>
    For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.”
</p>
<p>
A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<br>
    He first sent forth, and then began he: “Brother,<br>
    The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!
</p>
<p>
Ye who are living every cause refer<br>
    Still upward to the heavens, as if all things<br>
    They of necessity moved with themselves.
</p>
<p>
If this were so, in you would be destroyed<br>
    Free will, nor any justice would there be<br>
    In having joy for good, or grief for evil.
</p>
<p>
The heavens your movements do initiate,<br>
    I say not all; but granting that I say it,<br>
    Light has been given you for good and evil,
</p>
<p>
And free volition; which, if some fatigue<br>
    In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,<br>
    Afterwards conquers all, if well ’tis nurtured.
</p>
<p>
To greater force and to a better nature,<br>
    Though free, ye subject are, and that creates<br>
    The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.
</p>
<p>
Hence, if the present world doth go astray,<br>
    In you the cause is, be it sought in you;<br>
    And I therein will now be thy true spy.
</p>
<p>
Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it<br>
    Before it is, like to a little girl<br>
    Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,
</p>
<p>
Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,<br>
    Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,<br>
    Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;<br>
    Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<br>
    If guide or rein turn not aside its love.
</p>
<p>
Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,<br>
    Behoved a king to have, who at the least<br>
    Of the true city should discern the tower.
</p>
<p>
The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?<br>
    No one; because the shepherd who precedes<br>
    Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;
</p>
<p>
Wherefore the people that perceives its guide<br>
    Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<br>
    Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.
</p>
<p>
Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance<br>
    The cause is that has made the world depraved,<br>
    And not that nature is corrupt in you.
</p>
<p>
Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was<br>
    Two suns to have, which one road and the other,<br>
    Of God and of the world, made manifest.
</p>
<p>
One has the other quenched, and to the crosier<br>
    The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it<br>
    That by main force one with the other go,
</p>
<p>
Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;<br>
    If thou believe not, think upon the grain,<br>
    For by its seed each herb is recognized.
</p>
<p>
In the land laved by Po and Adige,<br>
    Valour and courtesy used to be found,<br>
    Before that Frederick had his controversy;
</p>
<p>
Now in security can pass that way<br>
    Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,<br>
    From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.
</p>
<p>
True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids<br>
    The ancient age the new, and late they deem it<br>
    That God restore them to the better life:
</p>
<p>
Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,<br>
    And Guido da Castel, who better named is,<br>
    In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:
</p>
<p>
Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,<br>
    Confounding in itself two governments,<br>
    Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.”
</p>
<p>
“O Marco mine,” I said, “thou reasonest well;<br>
    And now discern I why the sons of Levi<br>
    Have been excluded from the heritage.
</p>
<p>
But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample<br>
    Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained<br>
    In reprobation of the barbarous age?”
</p>
<p>
“Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,”<br>
    He answered me; “for speaking Tuscan to me,<br>
    It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.
</p>
<p>
By other surname do I know him not,<br>
    Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.<br>
    May God be with you, for I come no farther.
</p>
<p>
Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,<br>
    Already whitening; and I must depart—<br>
    Yonder the Angel is—ere he appear.”
</p>
<p>
Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XVII">
<p>
Remember, Reader, if e’er in the Alps<br>
    A mist o’ertook thee, through which thou couldst see<br>
    Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,
</p>
<p>
How, when the vapours humid and condensed<br>
    Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere<br>
    Of the sun feebly enters in among them,
</p>
<p>
And thy imagination will be swift<br>
    In coming to perceive how I re-saw<br>
    The sun at first, that was already setting.
</p>
<p>
Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master<br>
    Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud<br>
    To rays already dead on the low shores.
</p>
<p>
O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us<br>
    So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,<br>
    Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,
</p>
<p>
Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?<br>
    Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,<br>
    By self, or by a will that downward guides it.
</p>
<p>
Of her impiety, who changed her form<br>
    Into the bird that most delights in singing,<br>
    In my imagining appeared the trace;
</p>
<p>
And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn<br>
    Within itself, that from without there came<br>
    Nothing that then might be received by it.
</p>
<p>
Then reigned within my lofty fantasy<br>
    One crucified, disdainful and ferocious<br>
    In countenance, and even thus was dying.
</p>
<p>
Around him were the great Ahasuerus,<br>
    Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,<br>
    Who was in word and action so entire.
</p>
<p>
And even as this image burst asunder<br>
    Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble<br>
    In which the water it was made of fails,
</p>
<p>
There rose up in my vision a young maiden<br>
    Bitterly weeping, and she said: “O queen,<br>
    Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?
</p>
<p>
Thou’st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;<br>
    Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,<br>
    Mother, at thine ere at another’s ruin.”
</p>
<p>
As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden<br>
    New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,<br>
    And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,
</p>
<p>
So this imagining of mine fell down<br>
    As soon as the effulgence smote my face,<br>
    Greater by far than what is in our wont.
</p>
<p>
I turned me round to see where I might be,<br>
    When said a voice, “Here is the passage up;”<br>
    Which from all other purposes removed me,
</p>
<p>
And made my wish so full of eagerness<br>
    To look and see who was it that was speaking,<br>
    It never rests till meeting face to face;
</p>
<p>
But as before the sun, which quells the sight,<br>
    And in its own excess its figure veils,<br>
    Even so my power was insufficient here.
</p>
<p>
“This is a spirit divine, who in the way<br>
    Of going up directs us without asking,<br>
    And who with his own light himself conceals.
</p>
<p>
He does with us as man doth with himself;<br>
    For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,<br>
    Malignly leans already tow’rds denial.
</p>
<p>
Accord we now our feet to such inviting,<br>
    Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;<br>
    For then we could not till the day return.”
</p>
<p>
Thus my Conductor said; and I and he<br>
    Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;<br>
    And I, as soon as the first step I reached,
</p>
<p>
Near me perceived a motion as of wings,<br>
    And fanning in the face, and saying, “‘Beati<br>
    Pacifici,’ who are without ill anger.”
</p>
<p>
Already over us were so uplifted<br>
    The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,<br>
    That upon many sides the stars appeared.
</p>
<p>
“O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?”<br>
    I said within myself; for I perceived<br>
    The vigour of my legs was put in truce.
</p>
<p>
We at the point were where no more ascends<br>
    The stairway upward, and were motionless,<br>
    Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;
</p>
<p>
And I gave heed a little, if I might hear<br>
    Aught whatsoever in the circle new;<br>
    Then to my Master turned me round and said:
</p>
<p>
“Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency<br>
    Is purged here in the circle where we are?<br>
    Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “The love of good, remiss<br>
    In what it should have done, is here restored;<br>
    Here plied again the ill-belated oar;
</p>
<p>
But still more openly to understand,<br>
    Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather<br>
    Some profitable fruit from our delay.
</p>
<p>
Neither Creator nor a creature ever,<br>
    Son,” he began, “was destitute of love<br>
    Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.
</p>
<p>
The natural was ever without error;<br>
    But err the other may by evil object,<br>
    Or by too much, or by too little vigour.
</p>
<p>
While in the first it well directed is,<br>
    And in the second moderates itself,<br>
    It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;
</p>
<p>
But when to ill it turns, and, with more care<br>
    Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,<br>
    ’Gainst the Creator works his own creation.
</p>
<p>
Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be<br>
    The seed within yourselves of every virtue,<br>
    And every act that merits punishment.
</p>
<p>
Now inasmuch as never from the welfare<br>
    Of its own subject can love turn its sight,<br>
    From their own hatred all things are secure;
</p>
<p>
And since we cannot think of any being<br>
    Standing alone, nor from the First divided,<br>
    Of hating Him is all desire cut off.
</p>
<p>
Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,<br>
    The evil that one loves is of one’s neighbour,<br>
    And this is born in three modes in your clay.
</p>
<p>
There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,<br>
    Hope to excel, and therefore only long<br>
    That from his greatness he may be cast down;
</p>
<p>
There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown<br>
    Fear they may lose because another rises,<br>
    Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;
</p>
<p>
And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,<br>
    So that it makes them greedy for revenge,<br>
    And such must needs shape out another’s harm.
</p>
<p>
This threefold love is wept for down below;<br>
    Now of the other will I have thee hear,<br>
    That runneth after good with measure faulty.
</p>
<p>
Each one confusedly a good conceives<br>
    Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;<br>
    Therefore to overtake it each one strives.
</p>
<p>
If languid love to look on this attract you,<br>
    Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,<br>
    After just penitence, torments you for it.
</p>
<p>
There’s other good that does not make man happy;<br>
    ’Tis not felicity, ’tis not the good<br>
    Essence, of every good the fruit and root.
</p>
<p>
The love that yields itself too much to this<br>
    Above us is lamented in three circles;<br>
    But how tripartite it may be described,
</p>
<p>
I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XVIII">
<p>
An end had put unto his reasoning<br>
    The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking<br>
    Into my face, if I appeared content;
</p>
<p>
And I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,<br>
    Without was mute, and said within: “Perchance<br>
    The too much questioning I make annoys him.”
</p>
<p>
But that true Father, who had comprehended<br>
    The timid wish, that opened not itself,<br>
    By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.
</p>
<p>
Whence I: “My sight is, Master, vivified<br>
    So in thy light, that clearly I discern<br>
    Whate’er thy speech importeth or describes.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,<br>
    To teach me love, to which thou dost refer<br>
    Every good action and its contrary.”
</p>
<p>
“Direct,” he said, “towards me the keen eyes<br>
    Of intellect, and clear will be to thee<br>
    The error of the blind, who would be leaders.
</p>
<p>
The soul, which is created apt to love,<br>
    Is mobile unto everything that pleases,<br>
    Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.
</p>
<p>
Your apprehension from some real thing<br>
    An image draws, and in yourselves displays it<br>
    So that it makes the soul turn unto it.
</p>
<p>
And if, when turned, towards it she incline,<br>
    Love is that inclination; it is nature,<br>
    Which is by pleasure bound in you anew
</p>
<p>
Then even as the fire doth upward move<br>
    By its own form, which to ascend is born,<br>
    Where longest in its matter it endures,
</p>
<p>
So comes the captive soul into desire,<br>
    Which is a motion spiritual, and ne’er rests<br>
    Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.
</p>
<p>
Now may apparent be to thee how hidden<br>
    The truth is from those people, who aver<br>
    All love is in itself a laudable thing;
</p>
<p>
Because its matter may perchance appear<br>
    Aye to be good; but yet not each impression<br>
    Is good, albeit good may be the wax.”
</p>
<p>
“Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,”<br>
    I answered him, “have love revealed to me;<br>
    But that has made me more impregned with doubt;
</p>
<p>
For if love from without be offered us,<br>
    And with another foot the soul go not,<br>
    If right or wrong she go, ’tis not her merit.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “What reason seeth here,<br>
    Myself can tell thee; beyond that await<br>
    For Beatrice, since ’tis a work of faith.
</p>
<p>
Every substantial form, that segregate<br>
    From matter is, and with it is united,<br>
    Specific power has in itself collected,
</p>
<p>
Which without act is not perceptible,<br>
    Nor shows itself except by its effect,<br>
    As life does in a plant by the green leaves.
</p>
<p>
But still, whence cometh the intelligence<br>
    Of the first notions, man is ignorant,<br>
    And the affection for the first allurements,
</p>
<p>
Which are in you as instinct in the bee<br>
    To make its honey; and this first desire<br>
    Merit of praise or blame containeth not.
</p>
<p>
Now, that to this all others may be gathered,<br>
    Innate within you is the power that counsels,<br>
    And it should keep the threshold of assent.
</p>
<p>
This is the principle, from which is taken<br>
    Occasion of desert in you, according<br>
    As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.
</p>
<p>
Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,<br>
    Were of this innate liberty aware,<br>
    Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.
</p>
<p>
Supposing, then, that from necessity<br>
    Springs every love that is within you kindled,<br>
    Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.
</p>
<p>
The noble virtue Beatrice understands<br>
    By the free will; and therefore see that thou<br>
    Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it.”
</p>
<p>
The moon, belated almost unto midnight,<br>
    Now made the stars appear to us more rare,<br>
    Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,
</p>
<p>
And counter to the heavens ran through those paths<br>
    Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome<br>
    Sees it ’twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;
</p>
<p>
And that patrician shade, for whom is named<br>
    Pietola more than any Mantuan town,<br>
    Had laid aside the burden of my lading;
</p>
<p>
Whence I, who reason manifest and plain<br>
    In answer to my questions had received,<br>
    Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.
</p>
<p>
But taken from me was this drowsiness<br>
    Suddenly by a people, that behind<br>
    Our backs already had come round to us.
</p>
<p>
And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus<br>
    Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,<br>
    If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,
</p>
<p>
So they along that circle curve their step,<br>
    From what I saw of those approaching us,<br>
    Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.
</p>
<p>
Full soon they were upon us, because running<br>
    Moved onward all that mighty multitude,<br>
    And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,
</p>
<p>
“Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,<br>
    And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,<br>
    Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.”
</p>
<p>
“Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost<br>
    By little love!” forthwith the others cried,<br>
    “For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!”
</p>
<p>
“O folk, in whom an eager fervour now<br>
    Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,<br>
    Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,
</p>
<p>
This one who lives, and truly I lie not,<br>
    Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;<br>
    So tell us where the passage nearest is.”
</p>
<p>
These were the words of him who was my Guide;<br>
    And some one of those spirits said: “Come on<br>
    Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;
</p>
<p>
So full of longing are we to move onward,<br>
    That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,<br>
    If thou for churlishness our justice take.
</p>
<p>
I was San Zeno’s Abbot at Verona,<br>
    Under the empire of good Barbarossa,<br>
    Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;
</p>
<p>
And he has one foot in the grave already,<br>
    Who shall erelong lament that monastery,<br>
    And sorry be of having there had power,
</p>
<p>
Because his son, in his whole body sick,<br>
    And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,<br>
    He put into the place of its true pastor.”
</p>
<p>
If more he said, or silent was, I know not,<br>
    He had already passed so far beyond us;<br>
    But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.
</p>
<p>
And he who was in every need my succour<br>
    Said: “Turn thee hitherward; see two of them<br>
    Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.”
</p>
<p>
In rear of all they shouted: “Sooner were<br>
    The people dead to whom the sea was opened,<br>
    Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;
</p>
<p>
And those who the fatigue did not endure<br>
    Unto the issue, with Anchises’ son,<br>
    Themselves to life withouten glory offered.”
</p>
<p>
Then when from us so separated were<br>
    Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,<br>
    Within me a new thought did entrance find,
</p>
<p>
Whence others many and diverse were born;<br>
    And so I lapsed from one into another,<br>
    That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,
</p>
<p>
And meditation into dream transmuted.

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XIX">
<p>
It was the hour when the diurnal heat<br>
    No more can warm the coldness of the moon,<br>
    Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,
</p>
<p>
When geomancers their Fortuna Major<br>
    See in the orient before the dawn<br>
    Rise by a path that long remains not dim,
</p>
<p>
There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,<br>
    Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,<br>
    With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.
</p>
<p>
I looked at her; and as the sun restores<br>
    The frigid members which the night benumbs,<br>
    Even thus my gaze did render voluble
</p>
<p>
Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter<br>
    In little while, and the lost countenance<br>
    As love desires it so in her did colour.
</p>
<p>
When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,<br>
    She ’gan to sing so, that with difficulty<br>
    Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.
</p>
<p>
“I am,” she sang, “I am the Siren sweet<br>
    Who mariners amid the main unman,<br>
    So full am I of pleasantness to hear.
</p>
<p>
I drew Ulysses from his wandering way<br>
    Unto my song, and he who dwells with me<br>
    Seldom departs so wholly I content him.”
</p>
<p>
Her mouth was not yet closed again, before<br>
    Appeared a Lady saintly and alert<br>
    Close at my side to put her to confusion.
</p>
<p>
“Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?”<br>
    Sternly she said; and he was drawing near<br>
    With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.
</p>
<p>
She seized the other and in front laid open,<br>
    Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;<br>
    This waked me with the stench that issued from it.
</p>
<p>
I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:<br>
    “At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;<br>
    Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.”
</p>
<p>
I rose; and full already of high day<br>
    Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,<br>
    And with the new sun at our back we went.
</p>
<p>
Following behind him, I my forehead bore<br>
    Like unto one who has it laden with thought,<br>
    Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,
</p>
<p>
When I heard say, “Come, here the passage is,”<br>
    Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,<br>
    Such as we hear not in this mortal region.
</p>
<p>
With open wings, which of a swan appeared,<br>
    Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,<br>
    Between the two walls of the solid granite.
</p>
<p>
He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,<br>
    Affirming those ‘qui lugent’ to be blessed,<br>
    For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.
</p>
<p>
“What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?”<br>
    To me my Guide began to say, we both<br>
    Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.
</p>
<p>
And I: “With such misgiving makes me go<br>
    A vision new, which bends me to itself,<br>
    So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.”
</p>
<p>
“Didst thou behold,” he said, “that old enchantress,<br>
    Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?<br>
    Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?
</p>
<p>
Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,<br>
    Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls<br>
    The Eternal King with revolutions vast.”
</p>
<p>
Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,<br>
    Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,<br>
    Through the desire of food that draws him thither,
</p>
<p>
Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves<br>
    The rock to give a way to him who mounts,<br>
    Went on to where the circling doth begin.
</p>
<p>
On the fifth circle when I had come forth,<br>
    People I saw upon it who were weeping,<br>
    Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.
</p>
<p>
“Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,”<br>
    I heard them say with sighings so profound,<br>
    That hardly could the words be understood.
</p>
<p>
“O ye elect of God, whose sufferings<br>
    Justice and Hope both render less severe,<br>
    Direct ye us towards the high ascents.”
</p>
<p>
“If ye are come secure from this prostration,<br>
    And wish to find the way most speedily,<br>
    Let your right hands be evermore outside.”
</p>
<p>
Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered<br>
    By them somewhat in front of us; whence I<br>
    In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,
</p>
<p>
And unto my Lord’s eyes mine eyes I turned;<br>
    Whence he assented with a cheerful sign<br>
    To what the sight of my desire implored.
</p>
<p>
When of myself I could dispose at will,<br>
    Above that creature did I draw myself,<br>
    Whose words before had caused me to take note,
</p>
<p>
Saying: “O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens<br>
    That without which to God we cannot turn,<br>
    Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.
</p>
<p>
Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,<br>
    Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee<br>
    Anything there whence living I departed.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Wherefore our backs the heaven<br>
    Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand<br>
    ‘Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.’
</p>
<p>
Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends<br>
    A river beautiful, and of its name<br>
    The title of my blood its summit makes.
</p>
<p>
A month and little more essayed I how<br>
    Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it,<br>
    For all the other burdens seem a feather.
</p>
<p>
Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;<br>
    But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,<br>
    Then I discovered life to be a lie.
</p>
<p>
I saw that there the heart was not at rest,<br>
    Nor farther in that life could one ascend;<br>
    Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.
</p>
<p>
Until that time a wretched soul and parted<br>
    From God was I, and wholly avaricious;<br>
    Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.
</p>
<p>
What avarice does is here made manifest<br>
    In the purgation of these souls converted,<br>
    And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.
</p>
<p>
Even as our eye did not uplift itself<br>
    Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,<br>
    So justice here has merged it in the earth.
</p>
<p>
As avarice had extinguished our affection<br>
    For every good, whereby was action lost,<br>
    So justice here doth hold us in restraint,
</p>
<p>
Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;<br>
    And so long as it pleases the just Lord<br>
    Shall we remain immovable and prostrate.”
</p>
<p>
I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;<br>
    But even as I began, and he was ’ware,<br>
    Only by listening, of my reverence,
</p>
<p>
“What cause,” he said, “has downward bent thee thus?”<br>
    And I to him: “For your own dignity,<br>
    Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse.”
</p>
<p>
“Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,”<br>
    He answered: “Err not, fellow-servant am I<br>
    With thee and with the others to one power.
</p>
<p>
If e’er that holy, evangelic sound,<br>
    Which sayeth ‘neque nubent,’ thou hast heard,<br>
    Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.
</p>
<p>
Now go; no longer will I have thee linger,<br>
    Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,<br>
    With which I ripen that which thou hast said.
</p>
<p>
On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia,<br>
    Good in herself, unless indeed our house<br>
    Malevolent may make her by example,
</p>
<p>
And she alone remains to me on earth.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XX">
<p>
Ill strives the will against a better will;<br>
    Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure<br>
    I drew the sponge not saturate from the water.
</p>
<p>
Onward I moved, and onward moved my Leader,<br>
    Through vacant places, skirting still the rock,<br>
    As on a wall close to the battlements;
</p>
<p>
For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop<br>
    The malady which all the world pervades,<br>
    On the other side too near the verge approach.
</p>
<p>
Accursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf,<br>
    That more than all the other beasts hast prey,<br>
    Because of hunger infinitely hollow!
</p>
<p>
O heaven, in whose gyrations some appear<br>
    To think conditions here below are changed,<br>
    When will he come through whom she shall depart?
</p>
<p>
Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,<br>
    And I attentive to the shades I heard<br>
    Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;
</p>
<p>
And I by peradventure heard “Sweet Mary!”<br>
    Uttered in front of us amid the weeping<br>
    Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;
</p>
<p>
And in continuance: “How poor thou wast<br>
    Is manifested by that hostelry<br>
    Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.”
</p>
<p>
Thereafterward I heard: “O good Fabricius,<br>
    Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer<br>
    To the possession of great wealth with vice.”
</p>
<p>
So pleasurable were these words to me<br>
    That I drew farther onward to have knowledge<br>
    Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.
</p>
<p>
He furthermore was speaking of the largess<br>
    Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,<br>
    In order to conduct their youth to honour.
</p>
<p>
“O soul that dost so excellently speak,<br>
    Tell me who wast thou,” said I, “and why only<br>
    Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?
</p>
<p>
Not without recompense shall be thy word,<br>
    If I return to finish the short journey<br>
    Of that life which is flying to its end.”
</p>
<p>
And he: “I’ll tell thee, not for any comfort<br>
    I may expect from earth, but that so much<br>
    Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.
</p>
<p>
I was the root of that malignant plant<br>
    Which overshadows all the Christian world,<br>
    So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;
</p>
<p>
But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges<br>
    Had Power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;<br>
    And this I pray of Him who judges all.
</p>
<p>
Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;<br>
    From me were born the Louises and Philips,<br>
    By whom in later days has France been governed.
</p>
<p>
I was the son of a Parisian butcher,<br>
    What time the ancient kings had perished all,<br>
    Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.
</p>
<p>
I found me grasping in my hands the rein<br>
    Of the realm’s government, and so great power<br>
    Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,
</p>
<p>
That to the widowed diadem promoted<br>
    The head of mine own offspring was, from whom<br>
    The consecrated bones of these began.
</p>
<p>
So long as the great dowry of Provence<br>
    Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,<br>
    ’Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.
</p>
<p>
Then it began with falsehood and with force<br>
    Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,<br>
    Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.
</p>
<p>
Charles came to Italy, and for amends<br>
    A victim made of Conradin, and then<br>
    Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.
</p>
<p>
A time I see, not very distant now,<br>
    Which draweth forth another Charles from France,<br>
    The better to make known both him and his.
</p>
<p>
Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance<br>
    That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts<br>
    So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.
</p>
<p>
He thence not land, but sin and infamy,<br>
    Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself<br>
    As the more light such damage he accounts.
</p>
<p>
The other, now gone forth, ta’en in his ship,<br>
    See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her<br>
    As corsairs do with other female slaves.
</p>
<p>
What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,<br>
    Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,<br>
    It careth not for its own proper flesh?
</p>
<p>
That less may seem the future ill and past,<br>
    I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,<br>
    And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.
</p>
<p>
I see him yet another time derided;<br>
    I see renewed the vinegar and gall,<br>
    And between living thieves I see him slain.
</p>
<p>
I see the modern Pilate so relentless,<br>
    This does not sate him, but without decretal<br>
    He to the temple bears his sordid sails!
</p>
<p>
When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made<br>
    By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,<br>
    Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?
</p>
<p>
What I was saying of that only bride<br>
    Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee<br>
    To turn towards me for some commentary,
</p>
<p>
So long has been ordained to all our prayers<br>
    As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,<br>
    Contrary sound we take instead thereof.
</p>
<p>
At that time we repeat Pygmalion,<br>
    Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide<br>
    Made his insatiable desire of gold;
</p>
<p>
And the misery of avaricious Midas,<br>
    That followed his inordinate demand,<br>
    At which forevermore one needs but laugh.
</p>
<p>
The foolish Achan each one then records,<br>
    And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath<br>
    Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.
</p>
<p>
Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,<br>
    We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,<br>
    And the whole mount in infamy encircles
</p>
<p>
Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.<br>
    Here finally is cried: ‘O Crassus, tell us,<br>
    For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?’
</p>
<p>
Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,<br>
    According to desire of speech, that spurs us<br>
    To greater now and now to lesser pace.
</p>
<p>
But in the good that here by day is talked of,<br>
    Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by<br>
    No other person lifted up his voice.”
</p>
<p>
From him already we departed were,<br>
    And made endeavour to o’ercome the road<br>
    As much as was permitted to our power,
</p>
<p>
When I perceived, like something that is falling,<br>
    The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,<br>
    As seizes him who to his death is going.
</p>
<p>
Certes so violently shook not Delos,<br>
    Before Latona made her nest therein<br>
    To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.
</p>
<p>
Then upon all sides there began a cry,<br>
    Such that the Master drew himself towards me,<br>
    Saying, “Fear not, while I am guiding thee.”
</p>
<p>
“Gloria in excelsis Deo,” all<br>
    Were saying, from what near I comprehended,<br>
    Where it was possible to hear the cry.
</p>
<p>
We paused immovable and in suspense,<br>
    Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,<br>
    Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.
</p>
<p>
Then we resumed again our holy path,<br>
    Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,<br>
    Already turned to their accustomed plaint.
</p>
<p>
No ignorance ever with so great a strife<br>
    Had rendered me importunate to know,<br>
    If erreth not in this my memory,
</p>
<p>
As meditating then I seemed to have;<br>
    Nor out of haste to question did I dare,<br>
    Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;
</p>
<p>
So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXI">
<p>
The natural thirst, that ne’er is satisfied<br>
    Excepting with the water for whose grace<br>
    The woman of Samaria besought,
</p>
<p>
Put me in travail, and haste goaded me<br>
    Along the encumbered path behind my Leader<br>
    And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;
</p>
<p>
And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth<br>
    That Christ appeared to two upon the way<br>
    From the sepulchral cave already risen,
</p>
<p>
A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,<br>
    Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,<br>
    Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,
</p>
<p>
Saying, “My brothers, may God give you peace!”<br>
    We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered<br>
    To him the countersign thereto conforming.
</p>
<p>
Thereon began he: “In the blessed council,<br>
    Thee may the court veracious place in peace,<br>
    That me doth banish in eternal exile!”
</p>
<p>
“How,” said he, and the while we went with speed,<br>
    “If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,<br>
    Who up his stairs so far has guided you?”
</p>
<p>
And said my Teacher: “If thou note the marks<br>
    Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces<br>
    Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.
</p>
<p>
But because she who spinneth day and night<br>
    For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,<br>
    Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,
</p>
<p>
His soul, which is thy sister and my own,<br>
    In coming upwards could not come alone,<br>
    By reason that it sees not in our fashion.
</p>
<p>
Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat<br>
    Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him<br>
    As far on as my school has power to lead.
</p>
<p>
But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder<br>
    Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together<br>
    All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?”
</p>
<p>
In asking he so hit the very eye<br>
    Of my desire, that merely with the hope<br>
    My thirst became the less unsatisfied.
</p>
<p>
“Naught is there,” he began, “that without order<br>
    May the religion of the mountain feel,<br>
    Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.
</p>
<p>
Free is it here from every permutation;<br>
    What from itself heaven in itself receiveth<br>
    Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;
</p>
<p>
Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,<br>
    Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls<br>
    Than the short, little stairway of three steps.
</p>
<p>
Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,<br>
    Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,<br>
    That often upon earth her region shifts;
</p>
<p>
No arid vapour any farther rises<br>
    Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,<br>
    Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.
</p>
<p>
Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,<br>
    But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden<br>
    I know not how, up here it never trembled.
</p>
<p>
It trembles here, whenever any soul<br>
    Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves<br>
    To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.
</p>
<p>
Of purity the will alone gives proof,<br>
    Which, being wholly free to change its convent,<br>
    Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.
</p>
<p>
First it wills well; but the desire permits not,<br>
    Which divine justice with the self-same will<br>
    There was to sin, upon the torment sets.
</p>
<p>
And I, who have been lying in this pain<br>
    Five hundred years and more, but just now felt<br>
    A free volition for a better seat.
</p>
<p>
Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious<br>
    Spirits along the mountain rendering praise<br>
    Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.”
</p>
<p>
So said he to him; and since we enjoy<br>
    As much in drinking as the thirst is great,<br>
    I could not say how much it did me good.
</p>
<p>
And the wise Leader: “Now I see the net<br>
    That snares you here, and how ye are set free,<br>
    Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.
</p>
<p>
Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;<br>
    And why so many centuries thou hast here<br>
    Been lying, let me gather from thy words.”
</p>
<p>
“In days when the good Titus, with the aid<br>
    Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds<br>
    Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,
</p>
<p>
Under the name that most endures and honours,<br>
    Was I on earth,” that spirit made reply,<br>
    “Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.
</p>
<p>
My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome<br>
    Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,<br>
    Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.
</p>
<p>
Statius the people name me still on earth;<br>
    I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;<br>
    But on the way fell with my second burden.
</p>
<p>
The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks<br>
    Of that celestial flame which heated me,<br>
    Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;
</p>
<p>
Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me<br>
    A mother was, and was my nurse in song;<br>
    Without this weighed I not a drachma’s weight.
</p>
<p>
And to have lived upon the earth what time<br>
    Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun<br>
    More than I must ere issuing from my ban.”
</p>
<p>
These words towards me made Virgilius turn<br>
    With looks that in their silence said, “Be silent!”<br>
    But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;
</p>
<p>
For tears and laughter are such pursuivants<br>
    Unto the passion from which each springs forth,<br>
    In the most truthful least the will they follow.
</p>
<p>
I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;<br>
    Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed<br>
    Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;
</p>
<p>
And, “As thou well mayst consummate a labour<br>
    So great,” it said, “why did thy face just now<br>
    Display to me the lightning of a smile?”
</p>
<p>
Now am I caught on this side and on that;<br>
    One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,<br>
    Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.
</p>
<p>
“Speak,” said my Master, “and be not afraid<br>
    Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him<br>
    What he demands with such solicitude.”
</p>
<p>
Whence I: “Thou peradventure marvellest,<br>
    O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;<br>
    But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.
</p>
<p>
This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,<br>
    Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn<br>
    To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.
</p>
<p>
If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,<br>
    Abandon it as false, and trust it was<br>
    Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.”
</p>
<p>
Already he was stooping to embrace<br>
    My Teacher’s feet; but he said to him: “Brother,<br>
    Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.”
</p>
<p>
And he uprising: “Now canst thou the sum<br>
    Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,<br>
    When this our vanity I disremember,
</p>
<p>
Treating a shadow as substantial thing.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXII">
<p>
Already was the Angel left behind us,<br>
    The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,<br>
    Having erased one mark from off my face;
</p>
<p>
And those who have in justice their desire<br>
    Had said to us, “Beati,” in their voices,<br>
    With “sitio,” and without more ended it.
</p>
<p>
And I, more light than through the other passes,<br>
    Went onward so, that without any labour<br>
    I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;
</p>
<p>
When thus Virgilius began: “The love<br>
    Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,<br>
    Provided outwardly its flame appear.
</p>
<p>
Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended<br>
    Among us into the infernal Limbo,<br>
    Who made apparent to me thy affection,
</p>
<p>
My kindliness towards thee was as great<br>
    As ever bound one to an unseen person,<br>
    So that these stairs will now seem short to me.
</p>
<p>
But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,<br>
    If too great confidence let loose the rein,<br>
    And as a friend now hold discourse with me;
</p>
<p>
How was it possible within thy breast<br>
    For avarice to find place, ’mid so much wisdom<br>
    As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?”
</p>
<p>
These words excited Statius at first<br>
    Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:<br>
    “Each word of thine is love’s dear sign to me.
</p>
<p>
Verily oftentimes do things appear<br>
    Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,<br>
    Instead of the true causes which are hidden!
</p>
<p>
Thy question shows me thy belief to be<br>
    That I was niggard in the other life,<br>
    It may be from the circle where I was;
</p>
<p>
Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed<br>
    Too far from me; and this extravagance<br>
    Thousands of lunar periods have punished.
</p>
<p>
And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,<br>
    When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,<br>
    As if indignant, unto human nature,
</p>
<p>
‘To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger<br>
    Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?’<br>
    Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.
</p>
<p>
Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide<br>
    Their wings in spending, and repented me<br>
    As well of that as of my other sins;
</p>
<p>
How many with shorn hair shall rise again<br>
    Because of ignorance, which from this sin<br>
    Cuts off repentance living and in death!
</p>
<p>
And know that the transgression which rebuts<br>
    By direct opposition any sin<br>
    Together with it here its verdure dries.
</p>
<p>
Therefore if I have been among that folk<br>
    Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,<br>
    For its opposite has this befallen me.”
</p>
<p>
“Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons<br>
    Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,”<br>
    The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,
</p>
<p>
“From that which Clio there with thee preludes,<br>
    It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful<br>
    That faith without which no good works suffice.
</p>
<p>
If this be so, what candles or what sun<br>
    Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim<br>
    Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?”
</p>
<p>
And he to him: “Thou first directedst me<br>
    Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,<br>
    And first concerning God didst me enlighten.
</p>
<p>
Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,<br>
    Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,<br>
    But wary makes the persons after him,
</p>
<p>
When thou didst say: ‘The age renews itself,<br>
    Justice returns, and man’s primeval time,<br>
    And a new progeny descends from heaven.’
</p>
<p>
Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;<br>
    But that thou better see what I design,<br>
    To colour it will I extend my hand.
</p>
<p>
Already was the world in every part<br>
    Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated<br>
    By messengers of the eternal kingdom;
</p>
<p>
And thy assertion, spoken of above,<br>
    With the new preachers was in unison;<br>
    Whence I to visit them the custom took.
</p>
<p>
Then they became so holy in my sight,<br>
    That, when Domitian persecuted them,<br>
    Not without tears of mine were their laments;
</p>
<p>
And all the while that I on earth remained,<br>
    Them I befriended, and their upright customs<br>
    Made me disparage all the other sects.
</p>
<p>
And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers<br>
    Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,<br>
    But out of fear was covertly a Christian,
</p>
<p>
For a long time professing paganism;<br>
    And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle<br>
    To circuit round more than four centuries.
</p>
<p>
Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering<br>
    That hid from me whatever good I speak of,<br>
    While in ascending we have time to spare,
</p>
<p>
Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,<br>
    Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;<br>
    Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley.”
</p>
<p>
“These, Persius and myself, and others many,”<br>
    Replied my Leader, “with that Grecian are<br>
    Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,
</p>
<p>
In the first circle of the prison blind;<br>
    Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse<br>
    Which has our nurses ever with itself.
</p>
<p>
Euripides is with us, Antiphon,<br>
    Simonides, Agatho, and many other<br>
    Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.
</p>
<p>
There some of thine own people may be seen,<br>
    Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,<br>
    And there Ismene mournful as of old.
</p>
<p>
There she is seen who pointed out Langia;<br>
    There is Tiresias’ daughter, and there Thetis,<br>
    And there Deidamia with her sisters.”
</p>
<p>
Silent already were the poets both,<br>
    Attent once more in looking round about,<br>
    From the ascent and from the walls released;
</p>
<p>
And four handmaidens of the day already<br>
    Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth<br>
    Was pointing upward still its burning horn,
</p>
<p>
What time my Guide: “I think that tow’rds the edge<br>
    Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,<br>
    Circling the mount as we are wont to do.”
</p>
<p>
Thus in that region custom was our ensign;<br>
    And we resumed our way with less suspicion<br>
    For the assenting of that worthy soul
</p>
<p>
They in advance went on, and I alone<br>
    Behind them, and I listened to their speech,<br>
    Which gave me lessons in the art of song.
</p>
<p>
But soon their sweet discourses interrupted<br>
    A tree which midway in the road we found,<br>
    With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.
</p>
<p>
And even as a fir-tree tapers upward<br>
    From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;<br>
    I think in order that no one might climb it.
</p>
<p>
On that side where our pathway was enclosed<br>
    Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,<br>
    And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.
</p>
<p>
The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,<br>
    And from among the foliage a voice<br>
    Cried: “Of this food ye shall have scarcity.”
</p>
<p>
Then said: “More thoughtful Mary was of making<br>
    The marriage feast complete and honourable,<br>
    Than of her mouth which now for you responds;
</p>
<p>
And for their drink the ancient Roman women<br>
    With water were content; and Daniel<br>
    Disparaged food, and understanding won.
</p>
<p>
The primal age was beautiful as gold;<br>
    Acorns it made with hunger savorous,<br>
    And nectar every rivulet with thirst.
</p>
<p>
Honey and locusts were the aliments<br>
    That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;<br>
    Whence he is glorious, and so magnified
</p>
<p>
As by the Evangel is revealed to you.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXIII">
<p>
The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes<br>
    I riveted, as he is wont to do<br>
    Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,
</p>
<p>
My more than Father said unto me: “Son,<br>
    Come now; because the time that is ordained us<br>
    More usefully should be apportioned out.”
</p>
<p>
I turned my face and no less soon my steps<br>
    Unto the Sages, who were speaking so<br>
    They made the going of no cost to me;
</p>
<p>
And lo! were heard a song and a lament,<br>
    “Labia mea, Domine,” in fashion<br>
    Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.
</p>
<p>
“O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?”<br>
    Began I; and he answered: “Shades that go<br>
    Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.”
</p>
<p>
In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,<br>
    Who, unknown people on the road o’ertaking,<br>
    Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,
</p>
<p>
Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion<br>
    Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us<br>
    A crowd of spirits silent and devout.
</p>
<p>
Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,<br>
    Pallid in face, and so emaciate<br>
    That from the bones the skin did shape itself.
</p>
<p>
I do not think that so to merest rind<br>
    Could Erisichthon have been withered up<br>
    By famine, when most fear he had of it.
</p>
<p>
Thinking within myself I said: “Behold,<br>
    This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,<br>
    When Mary made a prey of her own son.”
</p>
<p>
Their sockets were like rings without the gems;<br>
    Whoever in the face of men reads ‘omo’<br>
    Might well in these have recognised the ‘m.’
</p>
<p>
Who would believe the odour of an apple,<br>
    Begetting longing, could consume them so,<br>
    And that of water, without knowing how?
</p>
<p>
I still was wondering what so famished them,<br>
    For the occasion not yet manifest<br>
    Of their emaciation and sad squalor;
</p>
<p>
And lo! from out the hollow of his head<br>
    His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;<br>
    Then cried aloud: “What grace to me is this?”
</p>
<p>
Never should I have known him by his look;<br>
    But in his voice was evident to me<br>
    That which his aspect had suppressed within it.
</p>
<p>
This spark within me wholly re-enkindled<br>
    My recognition of his altered face,<br>
    And I recalled the features of Forese.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,”<br>
    Entreated he, “which doth my skin discolour,<br>
    Nor at default of flesh that I may have;
</p>
<p>
But tell me truth of thee, and who are those<br>
    Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;<br>
    Do not delay in speaking unto me.”
</p>
<p>
“That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,<br>
    Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,”<br>
    I answered him, “beholding it so changed!
</p>
<p>
But tell me, for God’s sake, what thus denudes you?<br>
    Make me not speak while I am marvelling,<br>
    For ill speaks he who’s full of other longings.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “From the eternal council<br>
    Falls power into the water and the tree<br>
    Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.
</p>
<p>
All of this people who lamenting sing,<br>
    For following beyond measure appetite<br>
    In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.
</p>
<p>
Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us<br>
    The scent that issues from the apple-tree,<br>
    And from the spray that sprinkles o’er the verdure;
</p>
<p>
And not a single time alone, this ground<br>
    Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,—<br>
    I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,—
</p>
<p>
For the same wish doth lead us to the tree<br>
    Which led the Christ rejoicing to say ‘Eli,’<br>
    When with his veins he liberated us.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “Forese, from that day<br>
    When for a better life thou changedst worlds,<br>
    Up to this time five years have not rolled round.
</p>
<p>
If sooner were the power exhausted in thee<br>
    Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised<br>
    Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,
</p>
<p>
How hast thou come up hitherward already?<br>
    I thought to find thee down there underneath,<br>
    Where time for time doth restitution make.”
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Thus speedily has led me<br>
    To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,<br>
    My Nella with her overflowing tears;
</p>
<p>
She with her prayers devout and with her sighs<br>
    Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,<br>
    And from the other circles set me free.
</p>
<p>
So much more dear and pleasing is to God<br>
    My little widow, whom so much I loved,<br>
    As in good works she is the more alone;
</p>
<p>
For the Barbagia of Sardinia<br>
    By far more modest in its women is<br>
    Than the Barbagia I have left her in.
</p>
<p>
O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?<br>
    A future time is in my sight already,<br>
    To which this hour will not be very old,
</p>
<p>
When from the pulpit shall be interdicted<br>
    To the unblushing womankind of Florence<br>
    To go about displaying breast and paps.
</p>
<p>
What savages were e’er, what Saracens,<br>
    Who stood in need, to make them covered go,<br>
    Of spiritual or other discipline?
</p>
<p>
But if the shameless women were assured<br>
    Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already<br>
    Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;
</p>
<p>
For if my foresight here deceive me not,<br>
    They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks<br>
    Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.
</p>
<p>
O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;<br>
    See that not only I, but all these people<br>
    Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.”
</p>
<p>
Whence I to him: “If thou bring back to mind<br>
    What thou with me hast been and I with thee,<br>
    The present memory will be grievous still.
</p>
<p>
Out of that life he turned me back who goes<br>
    In front of me, two days agone when round<br>
    The sister of him yonder showed herself,”
</p>
<p>
And to the sun I pointed.  “Through the deep<br>
    Night of the truly dead has this one led me,<br>
    With this true flesh, that follows after him.
</p>
<p>
Thence his encouragements have led me up,<br>
    Ascending and still circling round the mount<br>
    That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.
</p>
<p>
He says that he will bear me company,<br>
    Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;<br>
    There it behoves me to remain without him.
</p>
<p>
This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,”<br>
    And him I pointed at; “the other is<br>
    That shade for whom just now shook every slope
</p>
<p>
Your realm, that from itself discharges him.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXIV">
<p>
Nor speech the going, nor the going that<br>
    Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,<br>
    Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.
</p>
<p>
And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,<br>
    From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed<br>
    Wonder at me, aware that I was living.
</p>
<p>
And I, continuing my colloquy,<br>
    Said: “Peradventure he goes up more slowly<br>
    Than he would do, for other people’s sake.
</p>
<p>
But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;<br>
    Tell me if any one of note I see<br>
    Among this folk that gazes at me so.”
</p>
<p>
“My sister, who, ’twixt beautiful and good,<br>
    I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing<br>
    Already in her crown on high Olympus.”
</p>
<p>
So said he first, and then: “’Tis not forbidden<br>
    To name each other here, so milked away<br>
    Is our resemblance by our dieting.
</p>
<p>
This,” pointing with his finger, “is Buonagiunta,<br>
    Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face<br>
    Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,
</p>
<p>
Has held the holy Church within his arms;<br>
    From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting<br>
    Bolsena’s eels and the Vernaccia wine.”
</p>
<p>
He named me many others one by one;<br>
    And all contented seemed at being named,<br>
    So that for this I saw not one dark look.
</p>
<p>
I saw for hunger bite the empty air<br>
    Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,<br>
    Who with his crook had pastured many people.
</p>
<p>
I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<br>
    Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,<br>
    And he was one who ne’er felt satisfied.
</p>
<p>
But as he does who scans, and then doth prize<br>
    One more than others, did I him of Lucca,<br>
    Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.
</p>
<p>
He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<br>
    From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<br>
    Of justice, that doth macerate them so.
</p>
<p>
“O soul,” I said, “that seemest so desirous<br>
    To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,<br>
    And with thy speech appease thyself and me.”
</p>
<p>
“A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,”<br>
    Began he, “who to thee shall pleasant make<br>
    My city, howsoever men may blame it.
</p>
<p>
Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;<br>
    If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,<br>
    True things hereafter will declare it to thee.
</p>
<p>
But say if him I here behold, who forth<br>
    Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<br>
    ‘Ladies, that have intelligence of love?’”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “One am I, who, whenever<br>
    Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure<br>
    Which he within me dictates, singing go.”
</p>
<p>
“O brother, now I see,” he said, “the knot<br>
    Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<br>
    Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.
</p>
<p>
I do perceive full clearly how your pens<br>
    Go closely following after him who dictates,<br>
    Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;
</p>
<p>
And he who sets himself to go beyond,<br>
    No difference sees from one style to another;”<br>
    And as if satisfied, he held his peace.
</p>
<p>
Even as the birds, that winter tow’rds the Nile,<br>
    Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,<br>
    Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;
</p>
<p>
In such wise all the people who were there,<br>
    Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,<br>
    Both by their leanness and their wishes light.
</p>
<p>
And as a man, who weary is with trotting,<br>
    Lets his companions onward go, and walks,<br>
    Until he vents the panting of his chest;
</p>
<p>
So did Forese let the holy flock<br>
    Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,<br>
    “When will it be that I again shall see thee?”
</p>
<p>
“How long,” I answered, “I may live, I know not;<br>
    Yet my return will not so speedy be,<br>
    But I shall sooner in desire arrive;
</p>
<p>
Because the place where I was set to live<br>
    From day to day of good is more depleted,<br>
    And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.”
</p>
<p>
“Now go,” he said, “for him most guilty of it<br>
    At a beast’s tail behold I dragged along<br>
    Towards the valley where is no repentance.
</p>
<p>
Faster at every step the beast is going,<br>
    Increasing evermore until it smites him,<br>
    And leaves the body vilely mutilated.
</p>
<p>
Not long those wheels shall turn,” and he uplifted<br>
    His eyes to heaven, “ere shall be clear to thee<br>
    That which my speech no farther can declare.
</p>
<p>
Now stay behind; because the time so precious<br>
    Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much<br>
    By coming onward thus abreast with thee.”
</p>
<p>
As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop<br>
    A cavalier from out a troop that ride,<br>
    And seeks the honour of the first encounter,
</p>
<p>
So he with greater strides departed from us;<br>
    And on the road remained I with those two,<br>
    Who were such mighty marshals of the world.
</p>
<p>
And when before us he had gone so far<br>
    Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants<br>
    As was my understanding to his words,
</p>
<p>
Appeared to me with laden and living boughs<br>
    Another apple-tree, and not far distant,<br>
    From having but just then turned thitherward.
</p>
<p>
People I saw beneath it lift their hands,<br>
    And cry I know not what towards the leaves,<br>
    Like little children eager and deluded,
</p>
<p>
Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,<br>
    But, to make very keen their appetite,<br>
    Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.
</p>
<p>
Then they departed as if undeceived;<br>
    And now we came unto the mighty tree<br>
    Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.
</p>
<p>
“Pass farther onward without drawing near;<br>
    The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<br>
    And out of that one has this tree been raised.”
</p>
<p>
Thus said I know not who among the branches;<br>
    Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself<br>
    Went crowding forward on the side that rises.
</p>
<p>
“Be mindful,” said he, “of the accursed ones<br>
    Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate<br>
    Combated Theseus with their double breasts;
</p>
<p>
And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,<br>
    Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<br>
    When he tow’rds Midian the hills descended.”
</p>
<p>
Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,<br>
    On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,<br>
    Followed forsooth by miserable gains;
</p>
<p>
Then set at large upon the lonely road,<br>
    A thousand steps and more we onward went,<br>
    In contemplation, each without a word.
</p>
<p>
“What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?”<br>
    Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started<br>
    As terrified and timid beasts are wont.
</p>
<p>
I raised my head to see who this might be,<br>
    And never in a furnace was there seen<br>
    Metals or glass so lucent and so red
</p>
<p>
As one I saw who said: “If it may please you<br>
    To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;<br>
    This way goes he who goeth after peace.”
</p>
<p>
His aspect had bereft me of my sight,<br>
    So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,<br>
    Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.
</p>
<p>
And as, the harbinger of early dawn,<br>
    The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,<br>
    Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,
</p>
<p>
So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst<br>
    My front, and felt the moving of the plumes<br>
    That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;
</p>
<p>
And heard it said: “Blessed are they whom grace<br>
    So much illumines, that the love of taste<br>
    Excites not in their breasts too great desire,
</p>
<p>
Hungering at all times so far as is just.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXV">
<p>
Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,<br>
    Because the sun had his meridian circle<br>
    To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;
</p>
<p>
Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,<br>
    But goes his way, whate’er to him appear,<br>
    If of necessity the sting transfix him,
</p>
<p>
In this wise did we enter through the gap,<br>
    Taking the stairway, one before the other,<br>
    Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.
</p>
<p>
And as the little stork that lifts its wing<br>
    With a desire to fly, and does not venture<br>
    To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,
</p>
<p>
Even such was I, with the desire of asking<br>
    Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming<br>
    He makes who doth address himself to speak.
</p>
<p>
Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,<br>
    My father sweet forbore, but said: “Let fly<br>
    The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.”
</p>
<p>
With confidence I opened then my mouth,<br>
    And I began: “How can one meagre grow<br>
    There where the need of nutriment applies not?”
</p>
<p>
“If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager<br>
    Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,<br>
    This would not,” said he, “be to thee so sour;
</p>
<p>
And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion<br>
    Trembles within a mirror your own image;<br>
    That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.
</p>
<p>
But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish<br>
    Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray<br>
    He now will be the healer of thy wounds.”
</p>
<p>
“If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,”<br>
    Responded Statius, “where thou present art,<br>
    Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.”
</p>
<p>
Then he began: “Son, if these words of mine<br>
    Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,<br>
    They’ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.
</p>
<p>
The perfect blood, which never is drunk up<br>
    Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth<br>
    Like food that from the table thou removest,
</p>
<p>
Takes in the heart for all the human members<br>
    Virtue informative, as being that<br>
    Which to be changed to them goes through the veins
</p>
<p>
Again digest, descends it where ’tis better<br>
    Silent to be than say; and then drops thence<br>
    Upon another’s blood in natural vase.
</p>
<p>
There one together with the other mingles,<br>
    One to be passive meant, the other active<br>
    By reason of the perfect place it springs from;
</p>
<p>
And being conjoined, begins to operate,<br>
    Coagulating first, then vivifying<br>
    What for its matter it had made consistent.
</p>
<p>
The active virtue, being made a soul<br>
    As of a plant, (in so far different,<br>
    This on the way is, that arrived already,)
</p>
<p>
Then works so much, that now it moves and feels<br>
    Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes<br>
    To organize the powers whose seed it is.
</p>
<p>
Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself<br>
    The virtue from the generator’s heart,<br>
    Where nature is intent on all the members.
</p>
<p>
But how from animal it man becomes<br>
    Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point<br>
    Which made a wiser man than thou once err
</p>
<p>
So far, that in his doctrine separate<br>
    He made the soul from possible intellect,<br>
    For he no organ saw by this assumed.
</p>
<p>
Open thy breast unto the truth that’s coming,<br>
    And know that, just as soon as in the foetus<br>
    The articulation of the brain is perfect,
</p>
<p>
The primal Motor turns to it well pleased<br>
    At so great art of nature, and inspires<br>
    A spirit new with virtue all replete,
</p>
<p>
Which what it finds there active doth attract<br>
    Into its substance, and becomes one soul,<br>
    Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.
</p>
<p>
And that thou less may wonder at my word,<br>
    Behold the sun’s heat, which becometh wine,<br>
    Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.
</p>
<p>
Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,<br>
    It separates from the flesh, and virtually<br>
    Bears with itself the human and divine;
</p>
<p>
The other faculties are voiceless all;<br>
    The memory, the intelligence, and the will<br>
    In action far more vigorous than before.
</p>
<p>
Without a pause it falleth of itself<br>
    In marvellous way on one shore or the other;<br>
    There of its roads it first is cognizant.
</p>
<p>
Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,<br>
    The virtue informative rays round about,<br>
    As, and as much as, in the living members.
</p>
<p>
And even as the air, when full of rain,<br>
    By alien rays that are therein reflected,<br>
    With divers colours shows itself adorned,
</p>
<p>
So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself<br>
    Into that form which doth impress upon it<br>
    Virtually the soul that has stood still.
</p>
<p>
And then in manner of the little flame,<br>
    Which followeth the fire where’er it shifts,<br>
    After the spirit followeth its new form.
</p>
<p>
Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,<br>
    It is called shade; and thence it organizes<br>
    Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.
</p>
<p>
Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;<br>
    Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,<br>
    That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.
</p>
<p>
According as impress us our desires<br>
    And other affections, so the shade is shaped,<br>
    And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.”
</p>
<p>
And now unto the last of all the circles<br>
    Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,<br>
    And were attentive to another care.
</p>
<p>
There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,<br>
    And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast<br>
    That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.
</p>
<p>
Hence we must needs go on the open side,<br>
    And one by one; and I did fear the fire<br>
    On this side, and on that the falling down.
</p>
<p>
My Leader said: “Along this place one ought<br>
    To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,<br>
    Seeing that one so easily might err.”
</p>
<p>
“Summae Deus clementiae,” in the bosom<br>
    Of the great burning chanted then I heard,<br>
    Which made me no less eager to turn round;
</p>
<p>
And spirits saw I walking through the flame;<br>
    Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs<br>
    Apportioning my sight from time to time.
</p>
<p>
After the close which to that hymn is made,<br>
    Aloud they shouted, “Virum non cognosco;”<br>
    Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.
</p>
<p>
This also ended, cried they: “To the wood<br>
    Diana ran, and drove forth Helice<br>
    Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.”
</p>
<p>
Then to their song returned they; then the wives<br>
    They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.<br>
    As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.
</p>
<p>
And I believe that them this mode suffices,<br>
    For all the time the fire is burning them;<br>
    With such care is it needful, and such food,
</p>
<p>
That the last wound of all should be closed up.

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXVI">
<p>
While on the brink thus one before the other<br>
    We went upon our way, oft the good Master<br>
    Said: “Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.”
</p>
<p>
On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,<br>
    That, raying out, already the whole west<br>
    Changed from its azure aspect into white.
</p>
<p>
And with my shadow did I make the flame<br>
    Appear more red; and even to such a sign<br>
    Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.
</p>
<p>
This was the cause that gave them a beginning<br>
    To speak of me; and to themselves began they<br>
    To say: “That seems not a factitious body!”
</p>
<p>
Then towards me, as far as they could come,<br>
    Came certain of them, always with regard<br>
    Not to step forth where they would not be burned.
</p>
<p>
“O thou who goest, not from being slower<br>
    But reverent perhaps, behind the others,<br>
    Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.
</p>
<p>
Nor to me only is thine answer needful;<br>
    For all of these have greater thirst for it<br>
    Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.
</p>
<p>
Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself<br>
    A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not<br>
    Entered as yet into the net of death.”
</p>
<p>
Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight<br>
    Should have revealed myself, were I not bent<br>
    On other novelty that then appeared.
</p>
<p>
For through the middle of the burning road<br>
    There came a people face to face with these,<br>
    Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.
</p>
<p>
There see I hastening upon either side<br>
    Each of the shades, and kissing one another<br>
    Without a pause, content with brief salute.
</p>
<p>
Thus in the middle of their brown battalions<br>
    Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another<br>
    Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.
</p>
<p>
No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,<br>
    Or ever the first footstep passes onward,<br>
    Each one endeavours to outcry the other;
</p>
<p>
The new-come people: “Sodom and Gomorrah!”<br>
    The rest: “Into the cow Pasiphae enters,<br>
    So that the bull unto her lust may run!”
</p>
<p>
Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains<br>
    Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,<br>
    These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,
</p>
<p>
One folk is going, and the other coming,<br>
    And weeping they return to their first songs,<br>
    And to the cry that most befitteth them;
</p>
<p>
And close to me approached, even as before,<br>
    The very same who had entreated me,<br>
    Attent to listen in their countenance.
</p>
<p>
I, who their inclination twice had seen,<br>
    Began: “O souls secure in the possession,<br>
    Whene’er it may be, of a state of peace,
</p>
<p>
Neither unripe nor ripened have remained<br>
    My members upon earth, but here are with me<br>
    With their own blood and their articulations.
</p>
<p>
I go up here to be no longer blind;<br>
    A Lady is above, who wins this grace,<br>
    Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.
</p>
<p>
But as your greatest longing satisfied<br>
    May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you<br>
    Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,
</p>
<p>
Tell me, that I again in books may write it,<br>
    Who are you, and what is that multitude<br>
    Which goes upon its way behind your backs?”
</p>
<p>
Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered<br>
    The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,<br>
    When rough and rustic to the town he goes,
</p>
<p>
Than every shade became in its appearance;<br>
    But when they of their stupor were disburdened,<br>
    Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,
</p>
<p>
“Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,”<br>
    He recommenced who first had questioned us,<br>
    “Experience freightest for a better life.
</p>
<p>
The folk that comes not with us have offended<br>
    In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,<br>
    Heard himself called in contumely, ‘Queen.’
</p>
<p>
Therefore they separate, exclaiming, ‘Sodom!’<br>
    Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,<br>
    And add unto their burning by their shame.
</p>
<p>
Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;<br>
    But because we observed not human law,<br>
    Following like unto beasts our appetite,
</p>
<p>
In our opprobrium by us is read,<br>
    When we part company, the name of her<br>
    Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.
</p>
<p>
Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;<br>
    Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,<br>
    There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.
</p>
<p>
Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;<br>
    I’m Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,<br>
    Having repented ere the hour extreme.”
</p>
<p>
The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus<br>
    Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,<br>
    Such I became, but rise not to such height,
</p>
<p>
The moment I heard name himself the father<br>
    Of me and of my betters, who had ever<br>
    Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;
</p>
<p>
And without speech and hearing thoughtfully<br>
    For a long time I went, beholding him,<br>
    Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.
</p>
<p>
When I was fed with looking, utterly<br>
    Myself I offered ready for his service,<br>
    With affirmation that compels belief.
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Thou leavest footprints such<br>
    In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,<br>
    Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.
</p>
<p>
But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,<br>
    Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest<br>
    In word and look that dear thou holdest me?”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “Those dulcet lays of yours<br>
    Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,<br>
    Shall make for ever dear their very ink!”
</p>
<p>
“O brother,” said he, “he whom I point out,”<br>
    And here he pointed at a spirit in front,<br>
    “Was of the mother tongue a better smith.
</p>
<p>
Verses of love and proses of romance,<br>
    He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,<br>
    Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.
</p>
<p>
To clamour more than truth they turn their faces,<br>
    And in this way establish their opinion,<br>
    Ere art or reason has by them been heard.
</p>
<p>
Thus many ancients with Guittone did,<br>
    From cry to cry still giving him applause,<br>
    Until the truth has conquered with most persons.
</p>
<p>
Now, if thou hast such ample privilege<br>
    ’Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister<br>
    Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,
</p>
<p>
To him repeat for me a Paternoster,<br>
    So far as needful to us of this world,<br>
    Where power of sinning is no longer ours.”
</p>
<p>
Then, to give place perchance to one behind,<br>
    Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire<br>
    As fish in water going to the bottom.
</p>
<p>
I moved a little tow’rds him pointed out,<br>
    And said that to his name my own desire<br>
    An honourable place was making ready.
</p>
<p>
He of his own free will began to say:<br>
    ‘Tan m’ abellis vostre cortes deman,<br>
    Que jeu nom’ puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;
</p>
<p>
Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;<br>
    Consiros vei la passada folor,<br>
    E vei jauzen lo jorn qu’ esper denan.
</p>
<p>
Ara vus prec per aquella valor,<br>
    Que vus condus al som de la scalina,<br>
    Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.’*
</p>
<p>
Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.
</p>
<p>
* So pleases me your courteous demand,<br>
    I cannot and I will not hide me from you.<br>
I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;<br>
    Contrite I see the folly of the past,<br>
    And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.<br>
Therefore do I implore you, by that power<br>
    Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,<br>
    Be mindful to assuage my suffering!

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXVII">
<p>
As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,<br>
    In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<br>
    (The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,
</p>
<p>
And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)<br>
    So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,<br>
    When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.
</p>
<p>
Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,<br>
    And chanted forth, “Beati mundo corde,”<br>
    In voice by far more living than our own.
</p>
<p>
Then: “No one farther goes, souls sanctified,<br>
    If first the fire bite not; within it enter,<br>
    And be not deaf unto the song beyond.”
</p>
<p>
When we were close beside him thus he said;<br>
    Wherefore e’en such became I, when I heard him,<br>
    As he is who is put into the grave.
</p>
<p>
Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,<br>
    Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling<br>
    The human bodies I had once seen burned.
</p>
<p>
Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,<br>
    And unto me Virgilius said: “My son,<br>
    Here may indeed be torment, but not death.
</p>
<p>
Remember thee, remember! and if I<br>
    On Geryon have safely guided thee,<br>
    What shall I do now I am nearer God?
</p>
<p>
Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full<br>
    Millennium in the bosom of this flame,<br>
    It could not make thee bald a single hair.
</p>
<p>
And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,<br>
    Draw near to it, and put it to the proof<br>
    With thine own hands upon thy garment’s hem.
</p>
<p>
Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,<br>
    Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;”<br>
    And I still motionless, and ’gainst my conscience!
</p>
<p>
Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,<br>
    Somewhat disturbed he said: “Now look thou, Son,<br>
    ’Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.”
</p>
<p>
As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<br>
    The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,<br>
    What time the mulberry became vermilion,
</p>
<p>
Even thus, my obduracy being softened,<br>
    I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name<br>
    That in my memory evermore is welling.
</p>
<p>
Whereat he wagged his head, and said: “How now?<br>
    Shall we stay on this side?” then smiled as one<br>
    Does at a child who’s vanquished by an apple.
</p>
<p>
Then into the fire in front of me he entered,<br>
    Beseeching Statius to come after me,<br>
    Who a long way before divided us.
</p>
<p>
When I was in it, into molten glass<br>
    I would have cast me to refresh myself,<br>
    So without measure was the burning there!
</p>
<p>
And my sweet Father, to encourage me,<br>
    Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,<br>
    Saying: “Her eyes I seem to see already!”
</p>
<p>
A voice, that on the other side was singing,<br>
    Directed us, and we, attent alone<br>
    On that, came forth where the ascent began.
</p>
<p>
“Venite, benedicti Patris mei,”<br>
    Sounded within a splendour, which was there<br>
    Such it o’ercame me, and I could not look.
</p>
<p>
“The sun departs,” it added, “and night cometh;<br>
    Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,<br>
    So long as yet the west becomes not dark.”
</p>
<p>
Straight forward through the rock the path ascended<br>
    In such a way that I cut off the rays<br>
    Before me of the sun, that now was low.
</p>
<p>
And of few stairs we yet had made assay,<br>
    Ere by the vanished shadow the sun’s setting<br>
    Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.
</p>
<p>
And ere in all its parts immeasurable<br>
    The horizon of one aspect had become,<br>
    And Night her boundless dispensation held,
</p>
<p>
Each of us of a stair had made his bed;<br>
    Because the nature of the mount took from us<br>
    The power of climbing, more than the delight.
</p>
<p>
Even as in ruminating passive grow<br>
    The goats, who have been swift and venturesome<br>
    Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,
</p>
<p>
Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,<br>
    Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff<br>
    Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;
</p>
<p>
And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,<br>
    Passes the night beside his quiet flock,<br>
    Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,
</p>
<p>
Such at that hour were we, all three of us,<br>
    I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,<br>
    Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.
</p>
<p>
Little could there be seen of things without;<br>
    But through that little I beheld the stars<br>
    More luminous and larger than their wont.
</p>
<p>
Thus ruminating, and beholding these,<br>
    Sleep seized upon me,—sleep, that oftentimes<br>
    Before a deed is done has tidings of it.
</p>
<p>
It was the hour, I think, when from the East<br>
    First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<br>
    Who with the fire of love seems always burning;
</p>
<p>
Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought<br>
    I saw a lady walking in a meadow,<br>
    Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:
</p>
<p>
“Know whosoever may my name demand<br>
    That I am Leah, and go moving round<br>
    My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.
</p>
<p>
To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,<br>
    But never does my sister Rachel leave<br>
    Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.
</p>
<p>
To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,<br>
    As I am to adorn me with my hands;<br>
    Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.”
</p>
<p>
And now before the antelucan splendours<br>
    That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,<br>
    As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,
</p>
<p>
The darkness fled away on every side,<br>
    And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,<br>
    Seeing already the great Masters risen.
</p>
<p>
“That apple sweet, which through so many branches<br>
    The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,<br>
    To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings.”
</p>
<p>
Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words<br>
    As these made use; and never were there guerdons<br>
    That could in pleasantness compare with these.
</p>
<p>
Such longing upon longing came upon me<br>
    To be above, that at each step thereafter<br>
    For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.
</p>
<p>
When underneath us was the stairway all<br>
    Run o’er, and we were on the highest step,<br>
    Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,
</p>
<p>
And said: “The temporal fire and the eternal,<br>
    Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come<br>
    Where of myself no farther I discern.
</p>
<p>
By intellect and art I here have brought thee;<br>
    Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;<br>
    Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.
</p>
<p>
Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;<br>
    Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs<br>
    Which of itself alone this land produces.
</p>
<p>
Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes<br>
    Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,<br>
    Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.
</p>
<p>
Expect no more or word or sign from me;<br>
    Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,<br>
    And error were it not to do its bidding;
</p>
<p>
Thee o’er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!”
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXVIII">
<p>
Eager already to search in and round<br>
    The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,<br>
    Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,
</p>
<p>
Withouten more delay I left the bank,<br>
    Taking the level country slowly, slowly<br>
    Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.
</p>
<p>
A softly-breathing air, that no mutation<br>
    Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me<br>
    No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,
</p>
<p>
Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,<br>
    Did all of them bow downward toward that side<br>
    Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;
</p>
<p>
Yet not from their upright direction swayed,<br>
    So that the little birds upon their tops<br>
    Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;
</p>
<p>
But with full ravishment the hours of prime,<br>
    Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,<br>
    That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,
</p>
<p>
Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on<br>
    Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,<br>
    When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.
</p>
<p>
Already my slow steps had carried me<br>
    Into the ancient wood so far, that I<br>
    Could not perceive where I had entered it.
</p>
<p>
And lo! my further course a stream cut off,<br>
    Which tow’rd the left hand with its little waves<br>
    Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.
</p>
<p>
All waters that on earth most limpid are<br>
    Would seem to have within themselves some mixture<br>
    Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,
</p>
<p>
Although it moves on with a brown, brown current<br>
    Under the shade perpetual, that never<br>
    Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.
</p>
<p>
With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed<br>
    Beyond the rivulet, to look upon<br>
    The great variety of the fresh may.
</p>
<p>
And there appeared to me (even as appears<br>
    Suddenly something that doth turn aside<br>
    Through very wonder every other thought)
</p>
<p>
A lady all alone, who went along<br>
    Singing and culling floweret after floweret,<br>
    With which her pathway was all painted over.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love<br>
    Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,<br>
    Which the heart’s witnesses are wont to be,
</p>
<p>
May the desire come unto thee to draw<br>
    Near to this river’s bank,” I said to her,<br>
    “So much that I might hear what thou art singing.
</p>
<p>
Thou makest me remember where and what<br>
    Proserpina that moment was when lost<br>
    Her mother her, and she herself the Spring.”
</p>
<p>
As turns herself, with feet together pressed<br>
    And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,<br>
    And hardly puts one foot before the other,
</p>
<p>
On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets<br>
    She turned towards me, not in other wise<br>
    Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;
</p>
<p>
And my entreaties made to be content,<br>
    So near approaching, that the dulcet sound<br>
    Came unto me together with its meaning
</p>
<p>
As soon as she was where the grasses are.<br>
    Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,<br>
    To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.
</p>
<p>
I do not think there shone so great a light<br>
    Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<br>
    By her own son, beyond his usual custom!
</p>
<p>
Erect upon the other bank she smiled,<br>
    Bearing full many colours in her hands,<br>
    Which that high land produces without seed.
</p>
<p>
Apart three paces did the river make us;<br>
    But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,<br>
    (A curb still to all human arrogance,)
</p>
<p>
More hatred from Leander did not suffer<br>
    For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,<br>
    Than that from me, because it oped not then.
</p>
<p>
“Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,”<br>
    Began she, “peradventure, in this place<br>
    Elect to human nature for its nest,
</p>
<p>
Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;<br>
    But the psalm ‘Delectasti’ giveth light<br>
    Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.
</p>
<p>
And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,<br>
    Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready<br>
    To all thy questionings, as far as needful.”
</p>
<p>
“The water,” said I, “and the forest’s sound,<br>
    Are combating within me my new faith<br>
    In something which I heard opposed to this.”
</p>
<p>
Whence she: “I will relate how from its cause<br>
    Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,<br>
    And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.
</p>
<p>
The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,<br>
    Created man good, and this goodly place<br>
    Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.
</p>
<p>
By his default short while he sojourned here;<br>
    By his default to weeping and to toil<br>
    He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.
</p>
<p>
That the disturbance which below is made<br>
    By exhalations of the land and water,<br>
    (Which far as may be follow after heat,)
</p>
<p>
Might not upon mankind wage any war,<br>
    This mount ascended tow’rds the heaven so high,<br>
    And is exempt, from there where it is locked.
</p>
<p>
Now since the universal atmosphere<br>
    Turns in a circuit with the primal motion<br>
    Unless the circle is broken on some side,
</p>
<p>
Upon this height, that all is disengaged<br>
    In living ether, doth this motion strike<br>
    And make the forest sound, for it is dense;
</p>
<p>
And so much power the stricken plant possesses<br>
    That with its virtue it impregns the air,<br>
    And this, revolving, scatters it around;
</p>
<p>
And yonder earth, according as ’tis worthy<br>
    In self or in its clime, conceives and bears<br>
    Of divers qualities the divers trees;
</p>
<p>
It should not seem a marvel then on earth,<br>
    This being heard, whenever any plant<br>
    Without seed manifest there taketh root.
</p>
<p>
And thou must know, this holy table-land<br>
    In which thou art is full of every seed,<br>
    And fruit has in it never gathered there.
</p>
<p>
The water which thou seest springs not from vein<br>
    Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,<br>
    Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;
</p>
<p>
But issues from a fountain safe and certain,<br>
    Which by the will of God as much regains<br>
    As it discharges, open on two sides.
</p>
<p>
Upon this side with virtue it descends,<br>
    Which takes away all memory of sin;<br>
    On that, of every good deed done restores it.
</p>
<p>
Here Lethe, as upon the other side<br>
    Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not<br>
    If first on either side it be not tasted.
</p>
<p>
This every other savour doth transcend;<br>
    And notwithstanding slaked so far may be<br>
    Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,
</p>
<p>
I’ll give thee a corollary still in grace,<br>
    Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear<br>
    If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.
</p>
<p>
Those who in ancient times have feigned in song<br>
    The Age of Gold and its felicity,<br>
    Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.
</p>
<p>
Here was the human race in innocence;<br>
    Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;<br>
    This is the nectar of which each one speaks.”
</p>
<p>
Then backward did I turn me wholly round<br>
    Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<br>
    They had been listening to these closing words;
</p>
<p>
Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXIX">
<p>
Singing like unto an enamoured lady<br>
    She, with the ending of her words, continued:<br>
    “Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.”
</p>
<p>
And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone<br>
    Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous<br>
    One to avoid and one to see the sun,
</p>
<p>
She then against the stream moved onward, going<br>
    Along the bank, and I abreast of her,<br>
    Her little steps with little steps attending.
</p>
<p>
Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<br>
    When equally the margins gave a turn,<br>
    In such a way, that to the East I faced.
</p>
<p>
Nor even thus our way continued far<br>
    Before the lady wholly turned herself<br>
    Unto me, saying, “Brother, look and listen!”
</p>
<p>
And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br>
    On every side athwart the spacious forest,<br>
    Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.
</p>
<p>
But since the lightning ceases as it comes,<br>
    And that continuing brightened more and more,<br>
    Within my thought I said, “What thing is this?”
</p>
<p>
And a delicious melody there ran<br>
    Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal<br>
    Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;
</p>
<p>
For there where earth and heaven obedient were,<br>
    The woman only, and but just created,<br>
    Could not endure to stay ’neath any veil;
</p>
<p>
Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,<br>
    I sooner should have tasted those delights<br>
    Ineffable, and for a longer time.
</p>
<p>
While ’mid such manifold first-fruits I walked<br>
    Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,<br>
    And still solicitous of more delights,
</p>
<p>
In front of us like an enkindled fire<br>
    Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,<br>
    And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.
</p>
<p>
O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,<br>
    Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,<br>
    The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!
</p>
<p>
Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,<br>
    And with her choir Urania must assist me,<br>
    To put in verse things difficult to think.
</p>
<p>
A little farther on, seven trees of gold<br>
    In semblance the long space still intervening<br>
    Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;
</p>
<p>
But when I had approached so near to them<br>
    The common object, which the sense deceives,<br>
    Lost not by distance any of its marks,
</p>
<p>
The faculty that lends discourse to reason<br>
    Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<br>
    And in the voices of the song “Hosanna!”
</p>
<p>
Above them flamed the harness beautiful,<br>
    Far brighter than the moon in the serene<br>
    Of midnight, at the middle of her month.
</p>
<p>
I turned me round, with admiration filled,<br>
    To good Virgilius, and he answered me<br>
    With visage no less full of wonderment.
</p>
<p>
Then back I turned my face to those high things,<br>
    Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,<br>
    They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.
</p>
<p>
The lady chid me: “Why dost thou burn only<br>
    So with affection for the living lights,<br>
    And dost not look at what comes after them?”
</p>
<p>
Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,<br>
    Coming behind them, garmented in white,<br>
    And such a whiteness never was on earth.
</p>
<p>
The water on my left flank was resplendent,<br>
    And back to me reflected my left side,<br>
    E’en as a mirror, if I looked therein.
</p>
<p>
When I upon my margin had such post<br>
    That nothing but the stream divided us,<br>
    Better to see I gave my steps repose;
</p>
<p>
And I beheld the flamelets onward go,<br>
    Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,<br>
    And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,
</p>
<p>
So that it overhead remained distinct<br>
    With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours<br>
    Whence the sun’s bow is made, and Delia’s girdle.
</p>
<p>
These standards to the rearward longer were<br>
    Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,<br>
    Ten paces were the outermost apart.
</p>
<p>
Under so fair a heaven as I describe<br>
    The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<br>
    Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.
</p>
<p>
They all of them were singing: “Blessed thou<br>
    Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed<br>
    For evermore shall be thy loveliness.”
</p>
<p>
After the flowers and other tender grasses<br>
    In front of me upon the other margin<br>
    Were disencumbered of that race elect,
</p>
<p>
Even as in heaven star followeth after star,<br>
    There came close after them four animals,<br>
    Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.
</p>
<p>
Plumed with six wings was every one of them,<br>
    The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus<br>
    If they were living would be such as these.
</p>
<p>
Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste<br>
    My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,<br>
    That I in this cannot be prodigal.
</p>
<p>
But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them<br>
    As he beheld them from the region cold<br>
    Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;
</p>
<p>
And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,<br>
    Such were they here; saving that in their plumage<br>
    John is with me, and differeth from him.
</p>
<p>
The interval between these four contained<br>
    A chariot triumphal on two wheels,<br>
    Which by a Griffin’s neck came drawn along;
</p>
<p>
And upward he extended both his wings<br>
    Between the middle list and three and three,<br>
    So that he injured none by cleaving it.
</p>
<p>
So high they rose that they were lost to sight;<br>
    His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,<br>
    And white the others with vermilion mingled.
</p>
<p>
Not only Rome with no such splendid car<br>
    E’er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,<br>
    But poor to it that of the Sun would be,—
</p>
<p>
That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up<br>
    At the importunate orison of Earth,<br>
    When Jove was so mysteriously just.
</p>
<p>
Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle<br>
    Came onward dancing; one so very red<br>
    That in the fire she hardly had been noted.
</p>
<p>
The second was as if her flesh and bones<br>
    Had all been fashioned out of emerald;<br>
    The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.
</p>
<p>
And now they seemed conducted by the white,<br>
    Now by the red, and from the song of her<br>
    The others took their step, or slow or swift.
</p>
<p>
Upon the left hand four made holiday<br>
    Vested in purple, following the measure<br>
    Of one of them with three eyes in her head.
</p>
<p>
In rear of all the group here treated of<br>
    Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,<br>
    But like in gait, each dignified and grave.
</p>
<p>
One showed himself as one of the disciples<br>
    Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature<br>
    Made for the animals she holds most dear;
</p>
<p>
Contrary care the other manifested,<br>
    With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused<br>
    Terror to me on this side of the river.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,<br>
    And behind all an aged man alone<br>
    Walking in sleep with countenance acute.
</p>
<p>
And like the foremost company these seven<br>
    Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce<br>
    No garland round about the head they wore,
</p>
<p>
But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;<br>
    At little distance would the sight have sworn<br>
    That all were in a flame above their brows.
</p>
<p>
And when the car was opposite to me<br>
    Thunder was heard; and all that folk august<br>
    Seemed to have further progress interdicted,
</p>
<p>
There with the vanward ensigns standing still.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXX">
<p>
When the Septentrion of the highest heaven<br>
    (Which never either setting knew or rising,<br>
    Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,
</p>
<p>
And which made every one therein aware<br>
    Of his own duty, as the lower makes<br>
    Whoever turns the helm to come to port)
</p>
<p>
Motionless halted, the veracious people,<br>
    That came at first between it and the Griffin,<br>
    Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.
</p>
<p>
And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,<br>
    Singing, “Veni, sponsa, de Libano”<br>
    Shouted three times, and all the others after.
</p>
<p>
Even as the Blessed at the final summons<br>
    Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,<br>
    Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,
</p>
<p>
So upon that celestial chariot<br>
    A hundred rose ‘ad vocem tanti senis,’<br>
    Ministers and messengers of life eternal.
</p>
<p>
They all were saying, “Benedictus qui venis,”<br>
    And, scattering flowers above and round about,<br>
    “Manibus o date lilia plenis.”
</p>
<p>
Ere now have I beheld, as day began,<br>
    The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,<br>
    And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;
</p>
<p>
And the sun’s face, uprising, overshadowed<br>
    So that by tempering influence of vapours<br>
    For a long interval the eye sustained it;
</p>
<p>
Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers<br>
    Which from those hands angelical ascended,<br>
    And downward fell again inside and out,
</p>
<p>
Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct<br>
    Appeared a lady under a green mantle,<br>
    Vested in colour of the living flame.
</p>
<p>
And my own spirit, that already now<br>
    So long a time had been, that in her presence<br>
    Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,
</p>
<p>
Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,<br>
    Through occult virtue that from her proceeded<br>
    Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.
</p>
<p>
As soon as on my vision smote the power<br>
    Sublime, that had already pierced me through<br>
    Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,
</p>
<p>
To the left hand I turned with that reliance<br>
    With which the little child runs to his mother,<br>
    When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,
</p>
<p>
To say unto Virgilius: “Not a drachm<br>
    Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;<br>
    I know the traces of the ancient flame.”
</p>
<p>
But us Virgilius of himself deprived<br>
    Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,<br>
    Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:
</p>
<p>
Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother<br>
    Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,<br>
    That weeping they should not again be darkened.
</p>
<p>
“Dante, because Virgilius has departed<br>
    Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;<br>
    For by another sword thou need’st must weep.”
</p>
<p>
E’en as an admiral, who on poop and prow<br>
    Comes to behold the people that are working<br>
    In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,
</p>
<p>
Upon the left hand border of the car,<br>
    When at the sound I turned of my own name,<br>
    Which of necessity is here recorded,
</p>
<p>
I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared<br>
    Veiled underneath the angelic festival,<br>
    Direct her eyes to me across the river.
</p>
<p>
Although the veil, that from her head descended,<br>
    Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,<br>
    Did not permit her to appear distinctly,
</p>
<p>
In attitude still royally majestic<br>
    Continued she, like unto one who speaks,<br>
    And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:
</p>
<p>
“Look at me well; in sooth I’m Beatrice!<br>
    How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?<br>
    Didst thou not know that man is happy here?”
</p>
<p>
Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,<br>
    But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,<br>
    So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.
</p>
<p>
As to the son the mother seems superb,<br>
    So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter<br>
    Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.
</p>
<p>
Silent became she, and the Angels sang<br>
    Suddenly, “In te, Domine, speravi:”<br>
    But beyond ‘pedes meos’ did not pass.
</p>
<p>
Even as the snow among the living rafters<br>
    Upon the back of Italy congeals,<br>
    Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,
</p>
<p>
And then, dissolving, trickles through itself<br>
    Whene’er the land that loses shadow breathes,<br>
    So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;
</p>
<p>
E’en thus was I without a tear or sigh,<br>
    Before the song of those who sing for ever<br>
    After the music of the eternal spheres.
</p>
<p>
But when I heard in their sweet melodies<br>
    Compassion for me, more than had they said,<br>
    “O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?”
</p>
<p>
The ice, that was about my heart congealed,<br>
    To air and water changed, and in my anguish<br>
    Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.
</p>
<p>
She, on the right-hand border of the car<br>
    Still firmly standing, to those holy beings<br>
    Thus her discourse directed afterwards:
</p>
<p>
“Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,<br>
    So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you<br>
    One step the ages make upon their path;
</p>
<p>
Therefore my answer is with greater care,<br>
    That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,<br>
    So that the sin and dole be of one measure.
</p>
<p>
Not only by the work of those great wheels,<br>
    That destine every seed unto some end,<br>
    According as the stars are in conjunction,
</p>
<p>
But by the largess of celestial graces,<br>
    Which have such lofty vapours for their rain<br>
    That near to them our sight approaches not,
</p>
<p>
Such had this man become in his new life<br>
    Potentially, that every righteous habit<br>
    Would have made admirable proof in him;
</p>
<p>
But so much more malignant and more savage<br>
    Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,<br>
    The more good earthly vigour it possesses.
</p>
<p>
Some time did I sustain him with my look;<br>
    Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,<br>
    I led him with me turned in the right way.
</p>
<p>
As soon as ever of my second age<br>
    I was upon the threshold and changed life,<br>
    Himself from me he took and gave to others.
</p>
<p>
When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,<br>
    And beauty and virtue were in me increased,<br>
    I was to him less dear and less delightful;
</p>
<p>
And into ways untrue he turned his steps,<br>
    Pursuing the false images of good,<br>
    That never any promises fulfil;
</p>
<p>
Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,<br>
    By means of which in dreams and otherwise<br>
    I called him back, so little did he heed them.
</p>
<p>
So low he fell, that all appliances<br>
    For his salvation were already short,<br>
    Save showing him the people of perdition.
</p>
<p>
For this I visited the gates of death,<br>
    And unto him, who so far up has led him,<br>
    My intercessions were with weeping borne.
</p>
<p>
God’s lofty fiat would be violated,<br>
    If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands<br>
    Should tasted be, withouten any scot
</p>
<p>
Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears.”
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXXI">
<p>
“O thou who art beyond the sacred river,”<br>
    Turning to me the point of her discourse,<br>
    That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,
</p>
<p>
She recommenced, continuing without pause,<br>
    “Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,<br>
    Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.”
</p>
<p>
My faculties were in so great confusion,<br>
    That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct<br>
    Than by its organs it was set at large.
</p>
<p>
Awhile she waited; then she said: “What thinkest?<br>
    Answer me; for the mournful memories<br>
    In thee not yet are by the waters injured.”
</p>
<p>
Confusion and dismay together mingled<br>
    Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight<br>
    Was needful to the understanding of it.
</p>
<p>
Even as a cross-bow breaks, when ’tis discharged<br>
    Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,<br>
    And with less force the arrow hits the mark,
</p>
<p>
So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,<br>
    Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,<br>
    And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.
</p>
<p>
Whence she to me: “In those desires of mine<br>
    Which led thee to the loving of that good,<br>
    Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,
</p>
<p>
What trenches lying traverse or what chains<br>
    Didst thou discover, that of passing onward<br>
    Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?
</p>
<p>
And what allurements or what vantages<br>
    Upon the forehead of the others showed,<br>
    That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?”
</p>
<p>
After the heaving of a bitter sigh,<br>
    Hardly had I the voice to make response,<br>
    And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.
</p>
<p>
Weeping I said: “The things that present were<br>
    With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,<br>
    Soon as your countenance concealed itself.”
</p>
<p>
And she: “Shouldst thou be silent, or deny<br>
    What thou confessest, not less manifest<br>
    Would be thy fault, by such a Judge ’tis known.
</p>
<p>
But when from one’s own cheeks comes bursting forth<br>
    The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal<br>
    Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.
</p>
<p>
But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame<br>
    For thy transgression, and another time<br>
    Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,
</p>
<p>
Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<br>
    So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way<br>
    My buried flesh should have directed thee.
</p>
<p>
Never to thee presented art or nature<br>
    Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein<br>
    I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.
</p>
<p>
And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee<br>
    By reason of my death, what mortal thing<br>
    Should then have drawn thee into its desire?
</p>
<p>
Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft<br>
    Of things fallacious to have risen up<br>
    To follow me, who was no longer such.
</p>
<p>
Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward<br>
    To wait for further blows, or little girl,<br>
    Or other vanity of such brief use.
</p>
<p>
The callow birdlet waits for two or three,<br>
    But to the eyes of those already fledged,<br>
    In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.”
</p>
<p>
Even as children silent in their shame<br>
    Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,<br>
    And conscious of their fault, and penitent;
</p>
<p>
So was I standing; and she said: “If thou<br>
    In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard<br>
    And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.”
</p>
<p>
With less resistance is a robust holm<br>
    Uprooted, either by a native wind<br>
    Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,
</p>
<p>
Than I upraised at her command my chin;<br>
    And when she by the beard the face demanded,<br>
    Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.
</p>
<p>
And as my countenance was lifted up,<br>
    Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<br>
    Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;
</p>
<p>
And, still but little reassured, mine eyes<br>
    Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,<br>
    That is one person only in two natures.
</p>
<p>
Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,<br>
    She seemed to me far more her ancient self<br>
    To excel, than others here, when she was here.
</p>
<p>
So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,<br>
    That of all other things the one which turned me<br>
    Most to its love became the most my foe.
</p>
<p>
Such self-conviction stung me at the heart<br>
    O’erpowered I fell, and what I then became<br>
    She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.
</p>
<p>
Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,<br>
    The lady I had found alone, above me<br>
    I saw, and she was saying, “Hold me, hold me.”
</p>
<p>
Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,<br>
    And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<br>
    Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.
</p>
<p>
When I was near unto the blessed shore,<br>
    “Asperges me,” I heard so sweetly sung,<br>
    Remember it I cannot, much less write it.
</p>
<p>
The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,<br>
    Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,<br>
    Where I was forced to swallow of the water.
</p>
<p>
Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought<br>
    Into the dance of the four beautiful,<br>
    And each one with her arm did cover me.
</p>
<p>
‘We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<br>
    Ere Beatrice descended to the world,<br>
    We as her handmaids were appointed her.
</p>
<p>
We’ll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant<br>
    Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine<br>
    The three beyond, who more profoundly look.’
</p>
<p>
Thus singing they began; and afterwards<br>
    Unto the Griffin’s breast they led me with them,<br>
    Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.
</p>
<p>
“See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,” they said;<br>
    “Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<br>
    Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.”
</p>
<p>
A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,<br>
    Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,<br>
    That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.
</p>
<p>
As in a glass the sun, not otherwise<br>
    Within them was the twofold monster shining,<br>
    Now with the one, now with the other nature.
</p>
<p>
Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,<br>
    When I beheld the thing itself stand still,<br>
    And in its image it transformed itself.
</p>
<p>
While with amazement filled and jubilant,<br>
    My soul was tasting of the food, that while<br>
    It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,
</p>
<p>
Themselves revealing of the highest rank<br>
    In bearing, did the other three advance,<br>
    Singing to their angelic saraband.
</p>
<p>
“Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,”<br>
    Such was their song, “unto thy faithful one,<br>
    Who has to see thee ta’en so many steps.
</p>
<p>
In grace do us the grace that thou unveil<br>
    Thy face to him, so that he may discern<br>
    The second beauty which thou dost conceal.”
</p>
<p>
O splendour of the living light eternal!<br>
    Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus<br>
    Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,
</p>
<p>
He would not seem to have his mind encumbered<br>
    Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,<br>
    Where the harmonious heaven o’ershadowed thee,
</p>
<p>
When in the open air thou didst unveil?
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXXII">
<p>
So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes<br>
    In satisfying their decennial thirst,<br>
    That all my other senses were extinct,
</p>
<p>
And upon this side and on that they had<br>
    Walls of indifference, so the holy smile<br>
    Drew them unto itself with the old net
</p>
<p>
When forcibly my sight was turned away<br>
    Towards my left hand by those goddesses,<br>
    Because I heard from them a “Too intently!”
</p>
<p>
And that condition of the sight which is<br>
    In eyes but lately smitten by the sun<br>
    Bereft me of my vision some short while;
</p>
<p>
But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,<br>
    I say the less in reference to the greater<br>
    Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,
</p>
<p>
I saw upon its right wing wheeled about<br>
    The glorious host returning with the sun<br>
    And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.
</p>
<p>
As underneath its shields, to save itself,<br>
    A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,<br>
    Before the whole thereof can change its front,
</p>
<p>
That soldiery of the celestial kingdom<br>
    Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us<br>
    Before the chariot had turned its pole.
</p>
<p>
Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,<br>
    And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,<br>
    But so that not a feather of him fluttered.
</p>
<p>
The lady fair who drew me through the ford<br>
    Followed with Statius and myself the wheel<br>
    Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.
</p>
<p>
So passing through the lofty forest, vacant<br>
    By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,<br>
    Angelic music made our steps keep time.
</p>
<p>
Perchance as great a space had in three flights<br>
    An arrow loosened from the string o’erpassed,<br>
    As we had moved when Beatrice descended.
</p>
<p>
I heard them murmur altogether, “Adam!”<br>
    Then circled they about a tree despoiled<br>
    Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.
</p>
<p>
Its tresses, which so much the more dilate<br>
    As higher they ascend, had been by Indians<br>
    Among their forests marvelled at for height.
</p>
<p>
“Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not<br>
    Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,<br>
    Since appetite by this was turned to evil.”
</p>
<p>
After this fashion round the tree robust<br>
    The others shouted; and the twofold creature:<br>
    “Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.”
</p>
<p>
And turning to the pole which he had dragged,<br>
    He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,<br>
    And what was of it unto it left bound.
</p>
<p>
In the same manner as our trees (when downward<br>
    Falls the great light, with that together mingled<br>
    Which after the celestial Lasca shines)
</p>
<p>
Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,<br>
    Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun<br>
    Harness his steeds beneath another star:
</p>
<p>
Less than of rose and more than violet<br>
    A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree<br>
    That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.
</p>
<p>
I never heard, nor here below is sung,<br>
    The hymn which afterward that people sang,<br>
    Nor did I bear the melody throughout.
</p>
<p>
Had I the power to paint how fell asleep<br>
    Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,<br>
    Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,
</p>
<p>
Even as a painter who from model paints<br>
    I would portray how I was lulled asleep;<br>
    He may, who well can picture drowsihood.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,<br>
    And say a splendour rent from me the veil<br>
    Of slumber, and a calling: “Rise, what dost thou?”
</p>
<p>
As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<br>
    Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,<br>
    And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,
</p>
<p>
Peter and John and James conducted were,<br>
    And, overcome, recovered at the word<br>
    By which still greater slumbers have been broken,
</p>
<p>
And saw their school diminished by the loss<br>
    Not only of Elias, but of Moses,<br>
    And the apparel of their Master changed;
</p>
<p>
So I revived, and saw that piteous one<br>
    Above me standing, who had been conductress<br>
    Aforetime of my steps beside the river,
</p>
<p>
And all in doubt I said, “Where’s Beatrice?”<br>
    And she: “Behold her seated underneath<br>
    The leafage new, upon the root of it.
</p>
<p>
Behold the company that circles her;<br>
    The rest behind the Griffin are ascending<br>
    With more melodious song, and more profound.”
</p>
<p>
And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,<br>
    Because already in my sight was she<br>
    Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.
</p>
<p>
Alone she sat upon the very earth,<br>
    Left there as guardian of the chariot<br>
    Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.
</p>
<p>
Encircling her, a cloister made themselves<br>
    The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<br>
    Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.
</p>
<p>
“Short while shalt thou be here a forester,<br>
    And thou shalt be with me for evermore<br>
    A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, for that world’s good which liveth ill,<br>
    Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,<br>
    Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.”
</p>
<p>
Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet<br>
    Of her commandments all devoted was,<br>
    My mind and eyes directed where she willed.
</p>
<p>
Never descended with so swift a motion<br>
    Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining<br>
    From out the region which is most remote,
</p>
<p>
As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<br>
    Down through the tree, rending away the bark,<br>
    As well as blossoms and the foliage new,
</p>
<p>
And he with all his might the chariot smote,<br>
    Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest<br>
    Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter saw I leap into the body<br>
    Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<br>
    That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.
</p>
<p>
But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,<br>
    My Lady put him to as swift a flight<br>
    As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.
</p>
<p>
Then by the way that it before had come,<br>
    Into the chariot’s chest I saw the Eagle<br>
    Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.
</p>
<p>
And such as issues from a heart that mourns,<br>
    A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:<br>
    “My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!”
</p>
<p>
Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between<br>
    Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<br>
    Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,
</p>
<p>
And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,<br>
    Drawing unto himself his tail malign,<br>
    Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.
</p>
<p>
That which remained behind, even as with grass<br>
    A fertile region, with the feathers, offered<br>
    Perhaps with pure intention and benign,
</p>
<p>
Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed<br>
    The pole and both the wheels so speedily,<br>
    A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.
</p>
<p>
Transfigured thus the holy edifice<br>
    Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,<br>
    Three on the pole and one at either corner.
</p>
<p>
The first were horned like oxen; but the four<br>
    Had but a single horn upon the forehead;<br>
    A monster such had never yet been seen!
</p>
<p>
Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,<br>
    Seated upon it, there appeared to me<br>
    A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,
</p>
<p>
And, as if not to have her taken from him,<br>
    Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<br>
    And ever and anon they kissed each other.
</p>
<p>
But because she her wanton, roving eye<br>
    Turned upon me, her angry paramour<br>
    Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.
</p>
<p>
Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,<br>
    He loosed the monster, and across the forest<br>
    Dragged it so far, he made of that alone
</p>
<p>
A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoII.XXXIII">
<p>
“Deus venerunt gentes,” alternating<br>
    Now three, now four, melodious psalmody<br>
    The maidens in the midst of tears began;
</p>
<p>
And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,<br>
    Listened to them with such a countenance,<br>
    That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.
</p>
<p>
But when the other virgins place had given<br>
    For her to speak, uprisen to her feet<br>
    With colour as of fire, she made response:
</p>
<p>
“‘Modicum, et non videbitis me;<br>
    Et iterum,’ my sisters predilect,<br>
    ‘Modicum, et vos videbitis me.’”
</p>
<p>
Then all the seven in front of her she placed;<br>
    And after her, by beckoning only, moved<br>
    Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.
</p>
<p>
So she moved onward; and I do not think<br>
    That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,<br>
    When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,
</p>
<p>
And with a tranquil aspect, “Come more quickly,”<br>
    To me she said, “that, if I speak with thee,<br>
    To listen to me thou mayst be well placed.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as I was with her as I should be,<br>
    She said to me: “Why, brother, dost thou not<br>
    Venture to question now, in coming with me?”
</p>
<p>
As unto those who are too reverential,<br>
    Speaking in presence of superiors,<br>
    Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,
</p>
<p>
It me befell, that without perfect sound<br>
    Began I: “My necessity, Madonna,<br>
    You know, and that which thereunto is good.”
</p>
<p>
And she to me: “Of fear and bashfulness<br>
    Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,<br>
    So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.
</p>
<p>
Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<br>
    Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty<br>
    Think that God’s vengeance does not fear a sop.
</p>
<p>
Without an heir shall not for ever be<br>
    The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,<br>
    Whence it became a monster, then a prey;
</p>
<p>
For verily I see, and hence narrate it,<br>
    The stars already near to bring the time,<br>
    From every hindrance safe, and every bar,
</p>
<p>
Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,<br>
    One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman<br>
    And that same giant who is sinning with her.
</p>
<p>
And peradventure my dark utterance,<br>
    Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,<br>
    Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;
</p>
<p>
But soon the facts shall be the Naiades<br>
    Who shall this difficult enigma solve,<br>
    Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.
</p>
<p>
Note thou; and even as by me are uttered<br>
    These words, so teach them unto those who live<br>
    That life which is a running unto death;
</p>
<p>
And bear in mind, whene’er thou writest them,<br>
    Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,<br>
    That twice already has been pillaged here.
</p>
<p>
Whoever pillages or shatters it,<br>
    With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,<br>
    Who made it holy for his use alone.
</p>
<p>
For biting that, in pain and in desire<br>
    Five thousand years and more the first-born soul<br>
    Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.
</p>
<p>
Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not<br>
    For special reason so pre-eminent<br>
    In height, and so inverted in its summit.
</p>
<p>
And if thy vain imaginings had not been<br>
    Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<br>
    And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,
</p>
<p>
Thou by so many circumstances only<br>
    The justice of the interdict of God<br>
    Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.
</p>
<p>
But since I see thee in thine intellect<br>
    Converted into stone and stained with sin,<br>
    So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,
</p>
<p>
I will too, if not written, at least painted,<br>
    Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason<br>
    That cinct with palm the pilgrim’s staff is borne.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “As by a signet is the wax<br>
    Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,<br>
    My brain is now imprinted by yourself.
</p>
<p>
But wherefore so beyond my power of sight<br>
    Soars your desirable discourse, that aye<br>
    The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?”
</p>
<p>
“That thou mayst recognize,” she said, “the school<br>
    Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far<br>
    Its doctrine follows after my discourse,
</p>
<p>
And mayst behold your path from the divine<br>
    Distant as far as separated is<br>
    From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.”
</p>
<p>
Whence her I answered: “I do not remember<br>
    That ever I estranged myself from you,<br>
    Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.”
</p>
<p>
“And if thou art not able to remember,”<br>
    Smiling she answered, “recollect thee now<br>
    That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;
</p>
<p>
And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,<br>
    Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates<br>
    Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.
</p>
<p>
Truly from this time forward shall my words<br>
    Be naked, so far as it is befitting<br>
    To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.”
</p>
<p>
And more coruscant and with slower steps<br>
    The sun was holding the meridian circle,<br>
    Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there
</p>
<p>
When halted (as he cometh to a halt,<br>
    Who goes before a squadron as its escort,<br>
    If something new he find upon his way)
</p>
<p>
The ladies seven at a dark shadow’s edge,<br>
    Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,<br>
    The Alp upon its frigid border wears.
</p>
<p>
In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<br>
    Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,<br>
    And slowly part, like friends, from one another.
</p>
<p>
“O light, O glory of the human race!<br>
    What stream is this which here unfolds itself<br>
    From out one source, and from itself withdraws?”
</p>
<p>
For such a prayer, ’twas said unto me, “Pray<br>
    Matilda that she tell thee;” and here answered,<br>
    As one does who doth free himself from blame,
</p>
<p>
The beautiful lady: “This and other things<br>
    Were told to him by me; and sure I am<br>
    The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.”
</p>
<p>
And Beatrice: “Perhaps a greater care,<br>
    Which oftentimes our memory takes away,<br>
    Has made the vision of his mind obscure.
</p>
<p>
But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;<br>
    Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,<br>
    Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.”
</p>
<p>
Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,<br>
    But makes its own will of another’s will<br>
    As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,
</p>
<p>
Even so, when she had taken hold of me,<br>
    The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius<br>
    Said, in her womanly manner, “Come with him.”
</p>
<p>
If, Reader, I possessed a longer space<br>
    For writing it, I yet would sing in part<br>
    Of the sweet draught that ne’er would satiate me;
</p>
<p>
But inasmuch as full are all the leaves<br>
    Made ready for this second canticle,<br>
    The curb of art no farther lets me go.
</p>
<p>
From the most holy water I returned<br>
    Regenerate, in the manner of new trees<br>
    That are renewed with a new foliage,
</p>
<p>
Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.I">
<p>
The glory of Him who moveth everything<br>
    Doth penetrate the universe, and shine<br>
    In one part more and in another less.
</p>
<p>
Within that heaven which most his light receives<br>
    Was I, and things beheld which to repeat<br>
    Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;
</p>
<p>
Because in drawing near to its desire<br>
    Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,<br>
    That after it the memory cannot go.
</p>
<p>
Truly whatever of the holy realm<br>
    I had the power to treasure in my mind<br>
    Shall now become the subject of my song.
</p>
<p>
O good Apollo, for this last emprise<br>
    Make of me such a vessel of thy power<br>
    As giving the beloved laurel asks!
</p>
<p>
One summit of Parnassus hitherto<br>
    Has been enough for me, but now with both<br>
    I needs must enter the arena left.
</p>
<p>
Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe<br>
    As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw<br>
    Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.
</p>
<p>
O power divine, lend’st thou thyself to me<br>
    So that the shadow of the blessed realm<br>
    Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,
</p>
<p>
Thou’lt see me come unto thy darling tree,<br>
    And crown myself thereafter with those leaves<br>
    Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.
</p>
<p>
So seldom, Father, do we gather them<br>
    For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,<br>
    (The fault and shame of human inclinations,)
</p>
<p>
That the Peneian foliage should bring forth<br>
    Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,<br>
    When any one it makes to thirst for it.
</p>
<p>
A little spark is followed by great flame;<br>
    Perchance with better voices after me<br>
    Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!
</p>
<p>
To mortal men by passages diverse<br>
    Uprises the world’s lamp; but by that one<br>
    Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,
</p>
<p>
With better course and with a better star<br>
    Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax<br>
    Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.
</p>
<p>
Almost that passage had made morning there<br>
    And evening here, and there was wholly white<br>
    That hemisphere, and black the other part,
</p>
<p>
When Beatrice towards the left-hand side<br>
    I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;<br>
    Never did eagle fasten so upon it!
</p>
<p>
And even as a second ray is wont<br>
    To issue from the first and reascend,<br>
    Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,
</p>
<p>
Thus of her action, through the eyes infused<br>
    In my imagination, mine I made,<br>
    And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.
</p>
<p>
There much is lawful which is here unlawful<br>
    Unto our powers, by virtue of the place<br>
    Made for the human species as its own.
</p>
<p>
Not long I bore it, nor so little while<br>
    But I beheld it sparkle round about<br>
    Like iron that comes molten from the fire;
</p>
<p>
And suddenly it seemed that day to day<br>
    Was added, as if He who has the power<br>
    Had with another sun the heaven adorned.
</p>
<p>
With eyes upon the everlasting wheels<br>
    Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her<br>
    Fixing my vision from above removed,
</p>
<p>
Such at her aspect inwardly became<br>
    As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him<br>
    Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.
</p>
<p>
To represent transhumanise in words<br>
    Impossible were; the example, then, suffice<br>
    Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.
</p>
<p>
If I was merely what of me thou newly<br>
    Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,<br>
    Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!
</p>
<p>
When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal<br>
    Desiring thee, made me attentive to it<br>
    By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,
</p>
<p>
Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled<br>
    By the sun’s flame, that neither rain nor river<br>
    E’er made a lake so widely spread abroad.
</p>
<p>
The newness of the sound and the great light<br>
    Kindled in me a longing for their cause,<br>
    Never before with such acuteness felt;
</p>
<p>
Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,<br>
    To quiet in me my perturbed mind,<br>
    Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,
</p>
<p>
And she began: “Thou makest thyself so dull<br>
    With false imagining, that thou seest not<br>
    What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.
</p>
<p>
Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;<br>
    But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,<br>
    Ne’er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.”
</p>
<p>
If of my former doubt I was divested<br>
    By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,<br>
    I in a new one was the more ensnared;
</p>
<p>
And said: “Already did I rest content<br>
    From great amazement; but am now amazed<br>
    In what way I transcend these bodies light.”
</p>
<p>
Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,<br>
    Her eyes directed tow’rds me with that look<br>
    A mother casts on a delirious child;
</p>
<p>
And she began: “All things whate’er they be<br>
    Have order among themselves, and this is form,<br>
    That makes the universe resemble God.
</p>
<p>
Here do the higher creatures see the footprints<br>
    Of the Eternal Power, which is the end<br>
    Whereto is made the law already mentioned.
</p>
<p>
In the order that I speak of are inclined<br>
    All natures, by their destinies diverse,<br>
    More or less near unto their origin;
</p>
<p>
Hence they move onward unto ports diverse<br>
    O’er the great sea of being; and each one<br>
    With instinct given it which bears it on.
</p>
<p>
This bears away the fire towards the moon;<br>
    This is in mortal hearts the motive power<br>
    This binds together and unites the earth.
</p>
<p>
Nor only the created things that are<br>
    Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,<br>
    But those that have both intellect and love.
</p>
<p>
The Providence that regulates all this<br>
    Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,<br>
    Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.
</p>
<p>
And thither now, as to a site decreed,<br>
    Bears us away the virtue of that cord<br>
    Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.
</p>
<p>
True is it, that as oftentimes the form<br>
    Accords not with the intention of the art,<br>
    Because in answering is matter deaf,
</p>
<p>
So likewise from this course doth deviate<br>
    Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,<br>
    Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,
</p>
<p>
(In the same wise as one may see the fire<br>
    Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus<br>
    Earthward is wrested by some false delight.
</p>
<p>
Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,<br>
    At thine ascent, than at a rivulet<br>
    From some high mount descending to the lowland.
</p>
<p>
Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived<br>
    Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,<br>
    As if on earth the living fire were quiet.”
</p>
<p>
Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.II">
<p>
O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,<br>
    Eager to listen, have been following<br>
    Behind my ship, that singing sails along,
</p>
<p>
Turn back to look again upon your shores;<br>
    Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,<br>
    In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.
</p>
<p>
The sea I sail has never yet been passed;<br>
    Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,<br>
    And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.
</p>
<p>
Ye other few who have the neck uplifted<br>
    Betimes to th’ bread of Angels upon which<br>
    One liveth here and grows not sated by it,
</p>
<p>
Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea<br>
    Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you<br>
    Upon the water that grows smooth again.
</p>
<p>
Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed<br>
    Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,<br>
    When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!
</p>
<p>
The con-created and perpetual thirst<br>
    For the realm deiform did bear us on,<br>
    As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.
</p>
<p>
Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;<br>
    And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt<br>
    And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,
</p>
<p>
Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing<br>
    Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she<br>
    From whom no care of mine could be concealed,
</p>
<p>
Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,<br>
    Said unto me: “Fix gratefully thy mind<br>
    On God, who unto the first star has brought us.”
</p>
<p>
It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,<br>
    Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright<br>
    As adamant on which the sun is striking.
</p>
<p>
Into itself did the eternal pearl<br>
    Receive us, even as water doth receive<br>
    A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.
</p>
<p>
If I was body, (and we here conceive not<br>
    How one dimension tolerates another,<br>
    Which needs must be if body enter body,)
</p>
<p>
More the desire should be enkindled in us<br>
    That essence to behold, wherein is seen<br>
    How God and our own nature were united.
</p>
<p>
There will be seen what we receive by faith,<br>
    Not demonstrated, but self-evident<br>
    In guise of the first truth that man believes.
</p>
<p>
I made reply: “Madonna, as devoutly<br>
    As most I can do I give thanks to Him<br>
    Who has removed me from the mortal world.
</p>
<p>
But tell me what the dusky spots may be<br>
    Upon this body, which below on earth<br>
    Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?”
</p>
<p>
Somewhat she smiled; and then, “If the opinion<br>
    Of mortals be erroneous,” she said,<br>
    “Where’er the key of sense doth not unlock,
</p>
<p>
Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee<br>
    Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,<br>
    Thou seest that the reason has short wings.
</p>
<p>
But tell me what thou think’st of it thyself.”<br>
    And I: “What seems to us up here diverse,<br>
    Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.”
</p>
<p>
And she: “Right truly shalt thou see immersed<br>
    In error thy belief, if well thou hearest<br>
    The argument that I shall make against it.
</p>
<p>
Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you<br>
    Which in their quality and quantity<br>
    May noted be of aspects different.
</p>
<p>
If this were caused by rare and dense alone,<br>
    One only virtue would there be in all<br>
    Or more or less diffused, or equally.
</p>
<p>
Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits<br>
    Of formal principles; and these, save one,<br>
    Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Besides, if rarity were of this dimness<br>
    The cause thou askest, either through and through<br>
    This planet thus attenuate were of matter,
</p>
<p>
Or else, as in a body is apportioned<br>
    The fat and lean, so in like manner this<br>
    Would in its volume interchange the leaves.
</p>
<p>
Were it the former, in the sun’s eclipse<br>
    It would be manifest by the shining through<br>
    Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.
</p>
<p>
This is not so; hence we must scan the other,<br>
    And if it chance the other I demolish,<br>
    Then falsified will thy opinion be.
</p>
<p>
But if this rarity go not through and through,<br>
    There needs must be a limit, beyond which<br>
    Its contrary prevents the further passing,
</p>
<p>
And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,<br>
    Even as a colour cometh back from glass,<br>
    The which behind itself concealeth lead.
</p>
<p>
Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself<br>
    More dimly there than in the other parts,<br>
    By being there reflected farther back.
</p>
<p>
From this reply experiment will free thee<br>
    If e’er thou try it, which is wont to be<br>
    The fountain to the rivers of your arts.
</p>
<p>
Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove<br>
    Alike from thee, the other more remote<br>
    Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.
</p>
<p>
Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back<br>
    Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors<br>
    And coming back to thee by all reflected.
</p>
<p>
Though in its quantity be not so ample<br>
    The image most remote, there shalt thou see<br>
    How it perforce is equally resplendent.
</p>
<p>
Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays<br>
    Naked the subject of the snow remains<br>
    Both of its former colour and its cold,
</p>
<p>
Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,<br>
    Will I inform with such a living light,<br>
    That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.
</p>
<p>
Within the heaven of the divine repose<br>
    Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies<br>
    The being of whatever it contains.
</p>
<p>
The following heaven, that has so many eyes,<br>
    Divides this being by essences diverse,<br>
    Distinguished from it, and by it contained.
</p>
<p>
The other spheres, by various differences,<br>
    All the distinctions which they have within them<br>
    Dispose unto their ends and their effects.
</p>
<p>
Thus do these organs of the world proceed,<br>
    As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;<br>
    Since from above they take, and act beneath.
</p>
<p>
Observe me well, how through this place I come<br>
    Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter<br>
    Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford
</p>
<p>
The power and motion of the holy spheres,<br>
    As from the artisan the hammer’s craft,<br>
    Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.
</p>
<p>
The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,<br>
    From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,<br>
    The image takes, and makes of it a seal.
</p>
<p>
And even as the soul within your dust<br>
    Through members different and accommodated<br>
    To faculties diverse expands itself,
</p>
<p>
So likewise this Intelligence diffuses<br>
    Its virtue multiplied among the stars.<br>
    Itself revolving on its unity.
</p>
<p>
Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage<br>
    Make with the precious body that it quickens,<br>
    In which, as life in you, it is combined.
</p>
<p>
From the glad nature whence it is derived,<br>
    The mingled virtue through the body shines,<br>
    Even as gladness through the living pupil.
</p>
<p>
From this proceeds whate’er from light to light<br>
    Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:<br>
    This is the formal principle that produces,
</p>
<p>
According to its goodness, dark and bright.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.III">
<p>
That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,<br>
    Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,<br>
    By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.
</p>
<p>
And, that I might confess myself convinced<br>
    And confident, so far as was befitting,<br>
    I lifted more erect my head to speak.
</p>
<p>
But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me<br>
    So close to it, in order to be seen,<br>
    That my confession I remembered not.
</p>
<p>
Such as through polished and transparent glass,<br>
    Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,<br>
    But not so deep as that their bed be lost,
</p>
<p>
Come back again the outlines of our faces<br>
    So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white<br>
    Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;
</p>
<p>
Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,<br>
    So that I ran in error opposite<br>
    To that which kindled love ’twixt man and fountain.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I became aware of them,<br>
    Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,<br>
    To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,
</p>
<p>
And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward<br>
    Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,<br>
    Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Marvel thou not,” she said to me, “because<br>
    I smile at this thy puerile conceit,<br>
    Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,
</p>
<p>
But turns thee, as ’tis wont, on emptiness.<br>
    True substances are these which thou beholdest,<br>
    Here relegate for breaking of some vow.
</p>
<p>
Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;<br>
    For the true light, which giveth peace to them,<br>
    Permits them not to turn from it their feet.”
</p>
<p>
And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful<br>
    To speak directed me, and I began,<br>
    As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:
</p>
<p>
“O well-created spirit, who in the rays<br>
    Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste<br>
    Which being untasted ne’er is comprehended,
</p>
<p>
Grateful ’twill be to me, if thou content me<br>
    Both with thy name and with your destiny.”<br>
    Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:
</p>
<p>
“Our charity doth never shut the doors<br>
    Against a just desire, except as one<br>
    Who wills that all her court be like herself.
</p>
<p>
I was a virgin sister in the world;<br>
    And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,<br>
    The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,
</p>
<p>
But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,<br>
    Who, stationed here among these other blessed,<br>
    Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.
</p>
<p>
All our affections, that alone inflamed<br>
    Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,<br>
    Rejoice at being of his order formed;
</p>
<p>
And this allotment, which appears so low,<br>
    Therefore is given us, because our vows<br>
    Have been neglected and in some part void.”
</p>
<p>
Whence I to her: “In your miraculous aspects<br>
    There shines I know not what of the divine,<br>
    Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;<br>
    But what thou tellest me now aids me so,<br>
    That the refiguring is easier to me.
</p>
<p>
But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,<br>
    Are you desirous of a higher place,<br>
    To see more or to make yourselves more friends?”
</p>
<p>
First with those other shades she smiled a little;<br>
    Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,<br>
    She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:
</p>
<p>
“Brother, our will is quieted by virtue<br>
    Of charity, that makes us wish alone<br>
    For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.
</p>
<p>
If to be more exalted we aspired,<br>
    Discordant would our aspirations be<br>
    Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;
</p>
<p>
Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,<br>
    If being in charity is needful here,<br>
    And if thou lookest well into its nature;
</p>
<p>
Nay, ’tis essential to this blest existence<br>
    To keep itself within the will divine,<br>
    Whereby our very wishes are made one;
</p>
<p>
So that, as we are station above station<br>
    Throughout this realm, to all the realm ’tis pleasing,<br>
    As to the King, who makes his will our will.
</p>
<p>
And his will is our peace; this is the sea<br>
    To which is moving onward whatsoever<br>
    It doth create, and all that nature makes.”
</p>
<p>
Then it was clear to me how everywhere<br>
    In heaven is Paradise, although the grace<br>
    Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.
</p>
<p>
But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,<br>
    And for another still remains the longing,<br>
    We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,
</p>
<p>
E’en thus did I; with gesture and with word,<br>
    To learn from her what was the web wherein<br>
    She did not ply the shuttle to the end.
</p>
<p>
“A perfect life and merit high in-heaven<br>
    A lady o’er us,” said she, “by whose rule<br>
    Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,
</p>
<p>
That until death they may both watch and sleep<br>
    Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts<br>
    Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.
</p>
<p>
To follow her, in girlhood from the world<br>
    I fled, and in her habit shut myself,<br>
    And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.
</p>
<p>
Then men accustomed unto evil more<br>
    Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;<br>
    God knows what afterward my life became.
</p>
<p>
This other splendour, which to thee reveals<br>
    Itself on my right side, and is enkindled<br>
    With all the illumination of our sphere,
</p>
<p>
What of myself I say applies to her;<br>
    A nun was she, and likewise from her head<br>
    Was ta’en the shadow of the sacred wimple.
</p>
<p>
But when she too was to the world returned<br>
    Against her wishes and against good usage,<br>
    Of the heart’s veil she never was divested.
</p>
<p>
Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,<br>
    Who from the second wind of Suabia<br>
    Brought forth the third and latest puissance.”
</p>
<p>
Thus unto me she spake, and then began<br>
    “Ave Maria” singing, and in singing<br>
    Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.
</p>
<p>
My sight, that followed her as long a time<br>
    As it was possible, when it had lost her<br>
    Turned round unto the mark of more desire,
</p>
<p>
And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;<br>
    But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,<br>
    That at the first my sight endured it not;
</p>
<p>
And this in questioning more backward made me.
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.IV">
<p>
Between two viands, equally removed<br>
    And tempting, a free man would die of hunger<br>
    Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.
</p>
<p>
So would a lamb between the ravenings<br>
    Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;<br>
    And so would stand a dog between two does.
</p>
<p>
Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,<br>
    Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,<br>
    Since it must be so, nor do I commend.
</p>
<p>
I held my peace; but my desire was painted<br>
    Upon my face, and questioning with that<br>
    More fervent far than by articulate speech.
</p>
<p>
Beatrice did as Daniel had done<br>
    Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath<br>
    Which rendered him unjustly merciless,
</p>
<p>
And said: “Well see I how attracteth thee<br>
    One and the other wish, so that thy care<br>
    Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.
</p>
<p>
Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,<br>
    The violence of others, for what reason<br>
    Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?
</p>
<p>
Again for doubting furnish thee occasion<br>
    Souls seeming to return unto the stars,<br>
    According to the sentiment of Plato.
</p>
<p>
These are the questions which upon thy wish<br>
    Are thrusting equally; and therefore first<br>
    Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.
</p>
<p>
He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,<br>
    Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John<br>
    Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,
</p>
<p>
Have not in any other heaven their seats,<br>
    Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,<br>
    Nor of existence more or fewer years;
</p>
<p>
But all make beautiful the primal circle,<br>
    And have sweet life in different degrees,<br>
    By feeling more or less the eternal breath.
</p>
<p>
They showed themselves here, not because allotted<br>
    This sphere has been to them, but to give sign<br>
    Of the celestial which is least exalted.
</p>
<p>
To speak thus is adapted to your mind,<br>
    Since only through the sense it apprehendeth<br>
    What then it worthy makes of intellect.
</p>
<p>
On this account the Scripture condescends<br>
    Unto your faculties, and feet and hands<br>
    To God attributes, and means something else;
</p>
<p>
And Holy Church under an aspect human<br>
    Gabriel and Michael represent to you,<br>
    And him who made Tobias whole again.
</p>
<p>
That which Timaeus argues of the soul<br>
    Doth not resemble that which here is seen,<br>
    Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.
</p>
<p>
He says the soul unto its star returns,<br>
    Believing it to have been severed thence<br>
    Whenever nature gave it as a form.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise<br>
    Than the words sound, and possibly may be<br>
    With meaning that is not to be derided.
</p>
<p>
If he doth mean that to these wheels return<br>
    The honour of their influence and the blame,<br>
    Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.
</p>
<p>
This principle ill understood once warped<br>
    The whole world nearly, till it went astray<br>
    Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.
</p>
<p>
The other doubt which doth disquiet thee<br>
    Less venom has, for its malevolence<br>
    Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.
</p>
<p>
That as unjust our justice should appear<br>
    In eyes of mortals, is an argument<br>
    Of faith, and not of sin heretical.
</p>
<p>
But still, that your perception may be able<br>
    To thoroughly penetrate this verity,<br>
    As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.
</p>
<p>
If it be violence when he who suffers<br>
    Co-operates not with him who uses force,<br>
    These souls were not on that account excused;
</p>
<p>
For will is never quenched unless it will,<br>
    But operates as nature doth in fire<br>
    If violence a thousand times distort it.
</p>
<p>
Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds<br>
    The force; and these have done so, having power<br>
    Of turning back unto the holy place.
</p>
<p>
If their will had been perfect, like to that<br>
    Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,<br>
    And Mutius made severe to his own hand,
</p>
<p>
It would have urged them back along the road<br>
    Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;<br>
    But such a solid will is all too rare.
</p>
<p>
And by these words, if thou hast gathered them<br>
    As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted<br>
    That would have still annoyed thee many times.
</p>
<p>
But now another passage runs across<br>
    Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself<br>
    Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.
</p>
<p>
I have for certain put into thy mind<br>
    That soul beatified could never lie,<br>
    For it is near the primal Truth,
</p>
<p>
And then thou from Piccarda might’st have heard<br>
    Costanza kept affection for the veil,<br>
    So that she seemeth here to contradict me.
</p>
<p>
Many times, brother, has it come to pass,<br>
    That, to escape from peril, with reluctance<br>
    That has been done it was not right to do,
</p>
<p>
E’en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<br>
    Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)<br>
    Not to lose pity pitiless became.
</p>
<p>
At this point I desire thee to remember<br>
    That force with will commingles, and they cause<br>
    That the offences cannot be excused.
</p>
<p>
Will absolute consenteth not to evil;<br>
    But in so far consenteth as it fears,<br>
    If it refrain, to fall into more harm.
</p>
<p>
Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,<br>
    She meaneth the will absolute, and I<br>
    The other, so that both of us speak truth.”
</p>
<p>
Such was the flowing of the holy river<br>
    That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;<br>
    This put to rest my wishes one and all.
</p>
<p>
“O love of the first lover, O divine,”<br>
    Said I forthwith, “whose speech inundates me<br>
    And warms me so, it more and more revives me,
</p>
<p>
My own affection is not so profound<br>
    As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;<br>
    Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.
</p>
<p>
Well I perceive that never sated is<br>
    Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,<br>
    Beyond which nothing true expands itself.
</p>
<p>
It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,<br>
    When it attains it; and it can attain it;<br>
    If not, then each desire would frustrate be.
</p>
<p>
Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,<br>
    Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<br>
    Which to the top from height to height impels us.
</p>
<p>
This doth invite me, this assurance give me<br>
    With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you<br>
    Another truth, which is obscure to me.
</p>
<p>
I wish to know if man can satisfy you<br>
    For broken vows with other good deeds, so<br>
    That in your balance they will not be light.”
</p>
<p>
Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<br>
    Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,<br>
    That, overcome my power, I turned my back
</p>
<p>
And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.V">
<p>
“If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<br>
    Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,<br>
    So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,
</p>
<p>
Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds<br>
    From perfect sight, which as it apprehends<br>
    To the good apprehended moves its feet.
</p>
<p>
Well I perceive how is already shining<br>
    Into thine intellect the eternal light,<br>
    That only seen enkindles always love;
</p>
<p>
And if some other thing your love seduce,<br>
    ’Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,<br>
    Ill understood, which there is shining through.
</p>
<p>
Thou fain wouldst know if with another service<br>
    For broken vow can such return be made<br>
    As to secure the soul from further claim.”
</p>
<p>
This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;<br>
    And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,<br>
    Continued thus her holy argument:
</p>
<p>
“The greatest gift that in his largess God<br>
    Creating made, and unto his own goodness<br>
    Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize
</p>
<p>
Most highly, is the freedom of the will,<br>
    Wherewith the creatures of intelligence<br>
    Both all and only were and are endowed.
</p>
<p>
Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,<br>
    The high worth of a vow, if it he made<br>
    So that when thou consentest God consents:
</p>
<p>
For, closing between God and man the compact,<br>
    A sacrifice is of this treasure made,<br>
    Such as I say, and made by its own act.
</p>
<p>
What can be rendered then as compensation?<br>
    Think’st thou to make good use of what thou’st offered,<br>
    With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.
</p>
<p>
Now art thou certain of the greater point;<br>
    But because Holy Church in this dispenses,<br>
    Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,
</p>
<p>
Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,<br>
    Because the solid food which thou hast taken<br>
    Requireth further aid for thy digestion.
</p>
<p>
Open thy mind to that which I reveal,<br>
    And fix it there within; for ’tis not knowledge,<br>
    The having heard without retaining it.
</p>
<p>
In the essence of this sacrifice two things<br>
    Convene together; and the one is that<br>
    Of which ’tis made, the other is the agreement.
</p>
<p>
This last for evermore is cancelled not<br>
    Unless complied with, and concerning this<br>
    With such precision has above been spoken.
</p>
<p>
Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews<br>
    To offer still, though sometimes what was offered<br>
    Might be commuted, as thou ought’st to know.
</p>
<p>
The other, which is known to thee as matter,<br>
    May well indeed be such that one errs not<br>
    If it for other matter be exchanged.
</p>
<p>
But let none shift the burden on his shoulder<br>
    At his arbitrament, without the turning<br>
    Both of the white and of the yellow key;
</p>
<p>
And every permutation deem as foolish,<br>
    If in the substitute the thing relinquished,<br>
    As the four is in six, be not contained.
</p>
<p>
Therefore whatever thing has so great weight<br>
    In value that it drags down every balance,<br>
    Cannot be satisfied with other spending.
</p>
<p>
Let mortals never take a vow in jest;<br>
    Be faithful and not blind in doing that,<br>
    As Jephthah was in his first offering,
</p>
<p>
Whom more beseemed to say, ‘I have done wrong,<br>
    Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish<br>
    Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,
</p>
<p>
Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<br>
    And made for her both wise and simple weep,<br>
    Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.’
</p>
<p>
Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;<br>
    Be ye not like a feather at each wind,<br>
    And think not every water washes you.
</p>
<p>
Ye have the Old and the New Testament,<br>
    And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you<br>
    Let this suffice you unto your salvation.
</p>
<p>
If evil appetite cry aught else to you,<br>
    Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<br>
    So that the Jew among you may not mock you.
</p>
<p>
Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<br>
    Its mother’s milk, and frolicsome and simple<br>
    Combats at its own pleasure with itself.”
</p>
<p>
Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;<br>
    Then all desireful turned herself again<br>
    To that part where the world is most alive.
</p>
<p>
Her silence and her change of countenance<br>
    Silence imposed upon my eager mind,<br>
    That had already in advance new questions;
</p>
<p>
And as an arrow that upon the mark<br>
    Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,<br>
    So did we speed into the second realm.
</p>
<p>
My Lady there so joyful I beheld,<br>
    As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<br>
    More luminous thereat the planet grew;
</p>
<p>
And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<br>
    What became I, who by my nature am<br>
    Exceeding mutable in every guise!
</p>
<p>
As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,<br>
    The fishes draw to that which from without<br>
    Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;
</p>
<p>
So I beheld more than a thousand splendours<br>
    Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:<br>
    “Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.”
</p>
<p>
And as each one was coming unto us,<br>
    Full of beatitude the shade was seen,<br>
    By the effulgence clear that issued from it.
</p>
<p>
Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning<br>
    No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have<br>
    An agonizing need of knowing more;
</p>
<p>
And of thyself thou’lt see how I from these<br>
    Was in desire of hearing their conditions,<br>
    As they unto mine eyes were manifest.
</p>
<p>
“O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes<br>
    To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,<br>
    Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned
</p>
<p>
With light that through the whole of heaven is spread<br>
    Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest<br>
    To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.”
</p>
<p>
Thus by some one among those holy spirits<br>
    Was spoken, and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak<br>
    Securely, and believe them even as Gods.”
</p>
<p>
“Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself<br>
    In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,<br>
    Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,
</p>
<p>
But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,<br>
    Spirit august, thy station in the sphere<br>
    That veils itself to men in alien rays.”
</p>
<p>
This said I in direction of the light<br>
    Which first had spoken to me; whence it became<br>
    By far more lucent than it was before.
</p>
<p>
Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<br>
    By too much light, when heat has worn away<br>
    The tempering influence of the vapours dense,
</p>
<p>
By greater rapture thus concealed itself<br>
    In its own radiance the figure saintly,<br>
    And thus close, close enfolded answered me
</p>
<p>
In fashion as the following Canto sings.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.VI">
<p>
“After that Constantine the eagle turned<br>
    Against the course of heaven, which it had followed<br>
    Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,
</p>
<p>
Two hundred years and more the bird of God<br>
    In the extreme of Europe held itself,<br>
    Near to the mountains whence it issued first;
</p>
<p>
And under shadow of the sacred plumes<br>
    It governed there the world from hand to hand,<br>
    And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.
</p>
<p>
Caesar I was, and am Justinian,<br>
    Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,<br>
    Took from the laws the useless and redundant;
</p>
<p>
And ere unto the work I was attent,<br>
    One nature to exist in Christ, not more,<br>
    Believed, and with such faith was I contented.
</p>
<p>
But blessed Agapetus, he who was<br>
    The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere<br>
    Pointed me out the way by words of his.
</p>
<p>
Him I believed, and what was his assertion<br>
    I now see clearly, even as thou seest<br>
    Each contradiction to be false and true.
</p>
<p>
As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,<br>
    God in his grace it pleased with this high task<br>
    To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,
</p>
<p>
And to my Belisarius I commended<br>
    The arms, to which was heaven’s right hand so joined<br>
    It was a signal that I should repose.
</p>
<p>
Now here to the first question terminates<br>
    My answer; but the character thereof<br>
    Constrains me to continue with a sequel,
</p>
<p>
In order that thou see with how great reason<br>
    Men move against the standard sacrosanct,<br>
    Both who appropriate and who oppose it.
</p>
<p>
Behold how great a power has made it worthy<br>
    Of reverence, beginning from the hour<br>
    When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.
</p>
<p>
Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode<br>
    Three hundred years and upward, till at last<br>
    The three to three fought for it yet again.
</p>
<p>
Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong<br>
    Down to Lucretia’s sorrow, in seven kings<br>
    O’ercoming round about the neighboring nations;
</p>
<p>
Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans<br>
    Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,<br>
    Against the other princes and confederates.
</p>
<p>
Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks<br>
    Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,<br>
    Received the fame I willingly embalm;
</p>
<p>
It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,<br>
    Who, following Hannibal, had passed across<br>
    The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;
</p>
<p>
Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young<br>
    Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill<br>
    Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;
</p>
<p>
Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed<br>
    To bring the whole world to its mood serene,<br>
    Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.
</p>
<p>
What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,<br>
    Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,<br>
    And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;
</p>
<p>
What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,<br>
    And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight<br>
    That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.
</p>
<p>
Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then<br>
    Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote<br>
    That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.
</p>
<p>
Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,<br>
    It saw again, and there where Hector lies,<br>
    And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.
</p>
<p>
From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;<br>
    Then wheeled itself again into your West,<br>
    Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.
</p>
<p>
From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer<br>
    Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,<br>
    And Modena and Perugia dolent were;
</p>
<p>
Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep<br>
    Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,<br>
    Took from the adder sudden and black death.
</p>
<p>
With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;<br>
    With him it placed the world in so great peace,<br>
    That unto Janus was his temple closed.
</p>
<p>
But what the standard that has made me speak<br>
    Achieved before, and after should achieve<br>
    Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,
</p>
<p>
Becometh in appearance mean and dim,<br>
    If in the hand of the third Caesar seen<br>
    With eye unclouded and affection pure,
</p>
<p>
Because the living Justice that inspires me<br>
    Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,<br>
    The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.
</p>
<p>
Now here attend to what I answer thee;<br>
    Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance<br>
    Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.
</p>
<p>
And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten<br>
    The Holy Church, then underneath its wings<br>
    Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.
</p>
<p>
Now hast thou power to judge of such as those<br>
    Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,<br>
    Which are the cause of all your miseries.
</p>
<p>
To the public standard one the yellow lilies<br>
    Opposes, the other claims it for a party,<br>
    So that ’tis hard to see which sins the most.
</p>
<p>
Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft<br>
    Beneath some other standard; for this ever<br>
    Ill follows he who it and justice parts.
</p>
<p>
And let not this new Charles e’er strike it down,<br>
    He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons<br>
    That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.
</p>
<p>
Already oftentimes the sons have wept<br>
    The father’s crime; and let him not believe<br>
    That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.
</p>
<p>
This little planet doth adorn itself<br>
    With the good spirits that have active been,<br>
    That fame and honour might come after them;
</p>
<p>
And whensoever the desires mount thither,<br>
    Thus deviating, must perforce the rays<br>
    Of the true love less vividly mount upward.
</p>
<p>
But in commensuration of our wages<br>
    With our desert is portion of our joy,<br>
    Because we see them neither less nor greater.
</p>
<p>
Herein doth living Justice sweeten so<br>
    Affection in us, that for evermore<br>
    It cannot warp to any iniquity.
</p>
<p>
Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;<br>
    So in this life of ours the seats diverse<br>
    Render sweet harmony among these spheres;
</p>
<p>
And in the compass of this present pearl<br>
    Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom<br>
    The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.
</p>
<p>
But the Provencals who against him wrought,<br>
    They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he<br>
    Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.
</p>
<p>
Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,<br>
    Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him<br>
    Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;
</p>
<p>
And then malicious words incited him<br>
    To summon to a reckoning this just man,<br>
    Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.
</p>
<p>
Then he departed poor and stricken in years,<br>
    And if the world could know the heart he had,<br>
    In begging bit by bit his livelihood,
</p>
<p>
Though much it laud him, it would laud him more.”

<p>
“Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,<br>
    Superillustrans claritate tua<br>
    Felices ignes horum malahoth!”
</p>
<p>
In this wise, to his melody returning,<br>
    This substance, upon which a double light<br>
    Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,
</p>
<p>
And to their dance this and the others moved,<br>
    And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks<br>
    Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.
</p>
<p>
Doubting was I, and saying, “Tell her, tell her,”<br>
    Within me, “tell her,” saying, “tell my Lady,”<br>
    Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;
</p>
<p>
And yet that reverence which doth lord it over<br>
    The whole of me only by B and ICE,<br>
    Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.
</p>
<p>
Short while did Beatrice endure me thus;<br>
    And she began, lighting me with a smile<br>
    Such as would make one happy in the fire:
</p>
<p>
“According to infallible advisement,<br>
    After what manner a just vengeance justly<br>
    Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,
</p>
<p>
But I will speedily thy mind unloose;<br>
    And do thou listen, for these words of mine<br>
    Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.
</p>
<p>
By not enduring on the power that wills<br>
    Curb for his good, that man who ne’er was born,<br>
    Damning himself damned all his progeny;
</p>
<p>
Whereby the human species down below<br>
    Lay sick for many centuries in great error,<br>
    Till to descend it pleased the Word of God
</p>
<p>
To where the nature, which from its own Maker<br>
    Estranged itself, he joined to him in person<br>
    By the sole act of his eternal love.
</p>
<p>
Now unto what is said direct thy sight;<br>
    This nature when united to its Maker,<br>
    Such as created, was sincere and good;
</p>
<p>
But by itself alone was banished forth<br>
    From Paradise, because it turned aside<br>
    Out of the way of truth and of its life.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the penalty the cross held out,<br>
    If measured by the nature thus assumed,<br>
    None ever yet with so great justice stung,
</p>
<p>
And none was ever of so great injustice,<br>
    Considering who the Person was that suffered,<br>
    Within whom such a nature was contracted.
</p>
<p>
From one act therefore issued things diverse;<br>
    To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;<br>
    Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.
</p>
<p>
It should no longer now seem difficult<br>
    To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance<br>
    By a just court was afterward avenged.
</p>
<p>
But now do I behold thy mind entangled<br>
    From thought to thought within a knot, from which<br>
    With great desire it waits to free itself.
</p>
<p>
Thou sayest, ‘Well discern I what I hear;<br>
    But it is hidden from me why God willed<br>
    For our redemption only this one mode.’
</p>
<p>
Buried remaineth, brother, this decree<br>
    Unto the eyes of every one whose nature<br>
    Is in the flame of love not yet adult.
</p>
<p>
Verily, inasmuch as at this mark<br>
    One gazes long and little is discerned,<br>
    Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.
</p>
<p>
Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn<br>
    All envy, burning in itself so sparkles<br>
    That the eternal beauties it unfolds.
</p>
<p>
Whate’er from this immediately distils<br>
    Has afterwards no end, for ne’er removed<br>
    Is its impression when it sets its seal.
</p>
<p>
Whate’er from this immediately rains down<br>
    Is wholly free, because it is not subject<br>
    Unto the influences of novel things.
</p>
<p>
The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;<br>
    For the blest ardour that irradiates all things<br>
    In that most like itself is most vivacious.
</p>
<p>
With all of these things has advantaged been<br>
    The human creature; and if one be wanting,<br>
    From his nobility he needs must fall.
</p>
<p>
’Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,<br>
    And render him unlike the Good Supreme,<br>
    So that he little with its light is blanched,
</p>
<p>
And to his dignity no more returns,<br>
    Unless he fill up where transgression empties<br>
    With righteous pains for criminal delights.
</p>
<p>
Your nature when it sinned so utterly<br>
    In its own seed, out of these dignities<br>
    Even as out of Paradise was driven,
</p>
<p>
Nor could itself recover, if thou notest<br>
    With nicest subtilty, by any way,<br>
    Except by passing one of these two fords:
</p>
<p>
Either that God through clemency alone<br>
    Had pardon granted, or that man himself<br>
    Had satisfaction for his folly made.
</p>
<p>
Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss<br>
    Of the eternal counsel, to my speech<br>
    As far as may be fastened steadfastly!
</p>
<p>
Man in his limitations had not power<br>
    To satisfy, not having power to sink<br>
    In his humility obeying then,
</p>
<p>
Far as he disobeying thought to rise;<br>
    And for this reason man has been from power<br>
    Of satisfying by himself excluded.
</p>
<p>
Therefore it God behoved in his own ways<br>
    Man to restore unto his perfect life,<br>
    I say in one, or else in both of them.
</p>
<p>
But since the action of the doer is<br>
    So much more grateful, as it more presents<br>
    The goodness of the heart from which it issues,
</p>
<p>
Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,<br>
    Has been contented to proceed by each<br>
    And all its ways to lift you up again;
</p>
<p>
Nor ’twixt the first day and the final night<br>
    Such high and such magnificent proceeding<br>
    By one or by the other was or shall be;
</p>
<p>
For God more bounteous was himself to give<br>
    To make man able to uplift himself,<br>
    Than if he only of himself had pardoned;
</p>
<p>
And all the other modes were insufficient<br>
    For justice, were it not the Son of God<br>
    Himself had humbled to become incarnate.
</p>
<p>
Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,<br>
    Return I to elucidate one place,<br>
    In order that thou there mayst see as I do.
</p>
<p>
Thou sayst: ‘I see the air, I see the fire,<br>
    The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures<br>
    Come to corruption, and short while endure;
</p>
<p>
And these things notwithstanding were created;’<br>
    Therefore if that which I have said were true,<br>
    They should have been secure against corruption.
</p>
<p>
The Angels, brother, and the land sincere<br>
    In which thou art, created may be called<br>
    Just as they are in their entire existence;
</p>
<p>
But all the elements which thou hast named,<br>
    And all those things which out of them are made,<br>
    By a created virtue are informed.
</p>
<p>
Created was the matter which they have;<br>
    Created was the informing influence<br>
    Within these stars that round about them go.
</p>
<p>
The soul of every brute and of the plants<br>
    By its potential temperament attracts<br>
    The ray and motion of the holy lights;
</p>
<p>
But your own life immediately inspires<br>
    Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it<br>
    So with herself, it evermore desires her.
</p>
<p>
And thou from this mayst argue furthermore<br>
    Your resurrection, if thou think again<br>
    How human flesh was fashioned at that time
</p>
<p>
When the first parents both of them were made.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.VIII">
<p>
The world used in its peril to believe<br>
    That the fair Cypria delirious love<br>
    Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;
</p>
<p>
Wherefore not only unto her paid honour<br>
    Of sacrifices and of votive cry<br>
    The ancient nations in the ancient error,
</p>
<p>
But both Dione honoured they and Cupid,<br>
    That as her mother, this one as her son,<br>
    And said that he had sat in Dido’s lap;
</p>
<p>
And they from her, whence I beginning take,<br>
    Took the denomination of the star<br>
    That woos the sun, now following, now in front.
</p>
<p>
I was not ware of our ascending to it;<br>
    But of our being in it gave full faith<br>
    My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.
</p>
<p>
And as within a flame a spark is seen,<br>
    And as within a voice a voice discerned,<br>
    When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,
</p>
<p>
Within that light beheld I other lamps<br>
    Move in a circle, speeding more and less,<br>
    Methinks in measure of their inward vision.
</p>
<p>
From a cold cloud descended never winds,<br>
    Or visible or not, so rapidly<br>
    They would not laggard and impeded seem
</p>
<p>
To any one who had those lights divine<br>
    Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration<br>
    Begun at first in the high Seraphim.
</p>
<p>
And behind those that most in front appeared<br>
    Sounded “Osanna!” so that never since<br>
    To hear again was I without desire.
</p>
<p>
Then unto us more nearly one approached,<br>
    And it alone began: “We all are ready<br>
    Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.
</p>
<p>
We turn around with the celestial Princes,<br>
    One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,<br>
    To whom thou in the world of old didst say,
</p>
<p>
‘Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;’<br>
    And are so full of love, to pleasure thee<br>
    A little quiet will not be less sweet.”
</p>
<p>
After these eyes of mine themselves had offered<br>
    Unto my Lady reverently, and she<br>
    Content and certain of herself had made them,
</p>
<p>
Back to the light they turned, which so great promise<br>
    Made of itself, and “Say, who art thou?” was<br>
    My voice, imprinted with a great affection.
</p>
<p>
O how and how much I beheld it grow<br>
    With the new joy that superadded was<br>
    Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!
</p>
<p>
Thus changed, it said to me: “The world possessed me<br>
    Short time below; and, if it had been more,<br>
    Much evil will be which would not have been.
</p>
<p>
My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,<br>
    Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me<br>
    Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.
</p>
<p>
Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;<br>
    For had I been below, I should have shown thee<br>
    Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.
</p>
<p>
That left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself<br>
    In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,<br>
    Me for its lord awaited in due time,
</p>
<p>
And that horn of Ausonia, which is towned<br>
    With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,<br>
    Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.
</p>
<p>
Already flashed upon my brow the crown<br>
    Of that dominion which the Danube waters<br>
    After the German borders it abandons;
</p>
<p>
And beautiful Trinacria, that is murky<br>
    ’Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf<br>
    Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)
</p>
<p>
Not through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,<br>
    Would have awaited her own monarchs still,<br>
    Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,
</p>
<p>
If evil lordship, that exasperates ever<br>
    The subject populations, had not moved<br>
    Palermo to the outcry of ‘Death! death!’
</p>
<p>
And if my brother could but this foresee,<br>
    The greedy poverty of Catalonia<br>
    Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;
</p>
<p>
For verily ’tis needful to provide,<br>
    Through him or other, so that on his bark<br>
    Already freighted no more freight be placed.
</p>
<p>
His nature, which from liberal covetous<br>
    Descended, such a soldiery would need<br>
    As should not care for hoarding in a chest.”
</p>
<p>
“Because I do believe the lofty joy<br>
    Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,<br>
    Where every good thing doth begin and end
</p>
<p>
Thou seest as I see it, the more grateful<br>
    Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,<br>
    That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.
</p>
<p>
Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,<br>
    Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,<br>
    How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth.”
</p>
<p>
This I to him; and he to me: “If I<br>
    Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest<br>
    Thy face thou’lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.
</p>
<p>
The Good which all the realm thou art ascending<br>
    Turns and contents, maketh its providence<br>
    To be a power within these bodies vast;
</p>
<p>
And not alone the natures are foreseen<br>
    Within the mind that in itself is perfect,<br>
    But they together with their preservation.
</p>
<p>
For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth<br>
    Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,<br>
    Even as a shaft directed to its mark.
</p>
<p>
If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk<br>
    Would in such manner its effects produce,<br>
    That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.
</p>
<p>
This cannot be, if the Intelligences<br>
    That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,<br>
    And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.
</p>
<p>
Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?”<br>
    And I: “Not so; for ’tis impossible<br>
    That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.”
</p>
<p>
Whence he again: “Now say, would it be worse<br>
    For men on earth were they not citizens?”<br>
    “Yes,” I replied; “and here I ask no reason.”
</p>
<p>
“And can they be so, if below they live not<br>
    Diversely unto offices diverse?<br>
    No, if your master writeth well for you.”
</p>
<p>
So came he with deductions to this point;<br>
    Then he concluded: “Therefore it behoves<br>
    The roots of your effects to be diverse.
</p>
<p>
Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,<br>
    Another Melchisedec, and another he<br>
    Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.
</p>
<p>
Revolving Nature, which a signet is<br>
    To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,<br>
    But not one inn distinguish from another;
</p>
<p>
Thence happens it that Esau differeth<br>
    In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes<br>
    From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.
</p>
<p>
A generated nature its own way<br>
    Would always make like its progenitors,<br>
    If Providence divine were not triumphant.
</p>
<p>
Now that which was behind thee is before thee;<br>
    But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,<br>
    With a corollary will I mantle thee.
</p>
<p>
Evermore nature, if it fortune find<br>
    Discordant to it, like each other seed<br>
    Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;
</p>
<p>
And if the world below would fix its mind<br>
    On the foundation which is laid by nature,<br>
    Pursuing that, ’twould have the people good.
</p>
<p>
But you unto religion wrench aside<br>
    Him who was born to gird him with the sword,<br>
    And make a king of him who is for sermons;
</p>
<p>
Therefore your footsteps wander from the road.”

<p>
Beautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles<br>
    Had me enlightened, he narrated to me<br>
    The treacheries his seed should undergo;
</p>
<p>
But said: “Be still and let the years roll round;”<br>
    So I can only say, that lamentation<br>
    Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.
</p>
<p>
And of that holy light the life already<br>
    Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,<br>
    As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.
</p>
<p>
Ah, souls deceived, and creatures impious,<br>
    Who from such good do turn away your hearts,<br>
    Directing upon vanity your foreheads!
</p>
<p>
And now, behold, another of those splendours<br>
    Approached me, and its will to pleasure me<br>
    It signified by brightening outwardly.
</p>
<p>
The eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were<br>
    Upon me, as before, of dear assent<br>
    To my desire assurance gave to me.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,<br>
    Thou blessed spirit,” I said, “and give me proof<br>
    That what I think in thee I can reflect!”
</p>
<p>
Whereat the light, that still was new to me,<br>
    Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,<br>
    As one delighted to do good, continued:
</p>
<p>
“Within that region of the land depraved<br>
    Of Italy, that lies between Rialto<br>
    And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava,
</p>
<p>
Rises a hill, and mounts not very high,<br>
    Wherefrom descended formerly a torch<br>
    That made upon that region great assault.
</p>
<p>
Out of one root were born both I and it;<br>
    Cunizza was I called, and here I shine<br>
    Because the splendour of this star o’ercame me.
</p>
<p>
But gladly to myself the cause I pardon<br>
    Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;<br>
    Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.
</p>
<p>
Of this so luculent and precious jewel,<br>
    Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,<br>
    Great fame remained; and ere it die away
</p>
<p>
This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.<br>
    See if man ought to make him excellent,<br>
    So that another life the first may leave!
</p>
<p>
And thus thinks not the present multitude<br>
    Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento,<br>
    Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.
</p>
<p>
But soon ’twill be that Padua in the marsh<br>
    Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,<br>
    Because the folk are stubborn against duty;
</p>
<p>
And where the Sile and Cagnano join<br>
    One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,<br>
    For catching whom e’en now the net is making.
</p>
<p>
Feltro moreover of her impious pastor<br>
    Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be<br>
    That for the like none ever entered Malta.

<p>
Ample exceedingly would be the vat<br>
    That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood,<br>
    And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce,
</p>
<p>
Of which this courteous priest shall make a gift<br>
    To show himself a partisan; and such gifts<br>
    Will to the living of the land conform.
</p>
<p>
Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,<br>
    From which shines out on us God Judicant,<br>
    So that this utterance seems good to us.”
</p>
<p>
Here it was silent, and it had the semblance<br>
    Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel<br>
    On which it entered as it was before.
</p>
<p>
The other joy, already known to me,<br>
    Became a thing transplendent in my sight,<br>
    As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.
</p>
<p>
Through joy effulgence is acquired above,<br>
    As here a smile; but down below, the shade<br>
    Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.
</p>
<p>
“God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,<br>
    Thy sight is,” said I, “so that never will<br>
    Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;
</p>
<p>
Thy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens<br>
    Glad, with the singing of those holy fires<br>
    Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,
</p>
<p>
Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings?<br>
    Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning<br>

“The greatest of the valleys where the water<br>

    Extends so far, that it meridian makes<br>
    Where it was wont before to make the horizon.
</p>
<p>
I was a dweller on that valley’s shore<br>
    ’Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short<br>

Folco that people called me unto whom<br>
    My name was known; and now with me this heaven<br>
    Imprints itself, as I did once with it;

For more the daughter of Belus never burned,<br>
    Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa,<br>
    Than I, so long as it became my locks,

Nor yet that Rodophean, who deluded<br>

Yet here is no repenting, but we smile,<br>
    Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,<br>
    But at the power which ordered and foresaw.
</p>
<p>
Here we behold the art that doth adorn<br>
    With such affection, and the good discover<br>
    Whereby the world above turns that below.
</p>
<p>
But that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear<br>
    Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born,<br>
    Still farther to proceed behoveth me.
</p>
<p>
Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light<br>
    That here beside me thus is scintillating,<br>
    Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water.
</p>
<p>
Then know thou, that within there is at rest<br>
    Rahab, and being to our order joined,<br>
    With her in its supremest grade ’tis sealed.
</p>
<p>
Into this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone<br>
    Cast by your world, before all other souls<br>
    First of Christ’s triumph was she taken up.
</p>
<p>
Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven,<br>
    Even as a palm of the high victory<br>
    Which he acquired with one palm and the other,
</p>
<p>
Because she favoured the first glorious deed<br>
    Of Joshua upon the Holy Land,<br>
    That little stirs the memory of the Pope.
</p>
<p>
Thy city, which an offshoot is of him<br>
    Who first upon his Maker turned his back,<br>
    And whose ambition is so sorely wept,
</p>
<p>
Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower<br>
    Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray<br>
    Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.
</p>
<p>
For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors<br>
    Are derelict, and only the Decretals<br>
    So studied that it shows upon their margins.
</p>
<p>
On this are Pope and Cardinals intent;<br>
    Their meditations reach not Nazareth,<br>
    There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded;
</p>
<p>
But Vatican and the other parts elect<br>
    Of Rome, which have a cemetery been<br>
    Unto the soldiery that followed Peter
</p>
<p>
Shall soon be free from this adultery.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.X">
<p>
Looking into his Son with all the Love<br>
    Which each of them eternally breathes forth,<br>
    The Primal and unutterable Power
</p>
<p>
Whate’er before the mind or eye revolves<br>
    With so much order made, there can be none<br>
    Who this beholds without enjoying Him.
</p>
<p>
Lift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels<br>
    With me thy vision straight unto that part<br>
    Where the one motion on the other strikes,
</p>
<p>
And there begin to contemplate with joy<br>
    That Master’s art, who in himself so loves it<br>
    That never doth his eye depart therefrom.
</p>
<p>
Behold how from that point goes branching off<br>
    The oblique circle, which conveys the planets,<br>
    To satisfy the world that calls upon them;
</p>
<p>
And if their pathway were not thus inflected,<br>
    Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain,<br>
    And almost every power below here dead.
</p>
<p>
If from the straight line distant more or less<br>
    Were the departure, much would wanting be<br>
    Above and underneath of mundane order.
</p>
<p>
Remain now, Reader, still upon thy bench,<br>
    In thought pursuing that which is foretasted,<br>
    If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary.
</p>
<p>
I’ve set before thee; henceforth feed thyself,<br>
    For to itself diverteth all my care<br>
    That theme whereof I have been made the scribe.
</p>
<p>
The greatest of the ministers of nature,<br>
    Who with the power of heaven the world imprints<br>
    And measures with his light the time for us,
</p>
<p>
With that part which above is called to mind<br>
    Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving,<br>
    Where each time earlier he presents himself;
</p>
<p>
And I was with him; but of the ascending<br>
    I was not conscious, saving as a man<br>
    Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;
</p>
<p>
And Beatrice, she who is seen to pass<br>
    From good to better, and so suddenly<br>
    That not by time her action is expressed,
</p>
<p>
How lucent in herself must she have been!<br>
    And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,<br>
    Apparent not by colour but by light,
</p>
<p>
I, though I call on genius, art, and practice,<br>
    Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;<br>
    Believe one can, and let him long to see it.
</p>
<p>
And if our fantasies too lowly are<br>
    For altitude so great, it is no marvel,<br>
    Since o’er the sun was never eye could go.
</p>
<p>
Such in this place was the fourth family<br>
    Of the high Father, who forever sates it,<br>
    Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.
</p>
<p>
And Beatrice began: “Give thanks, give thanks<br>
    Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this<br>
    Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!”
</p>
<p>
Never was heart of mortal so disposed<br>
    To worship, nor to give itself to God<br>
    With all its gratitude was it so ready,
</p>
<p>
As at those words did I myself become;<br>
    And all my love was so absorbed in Him,<br>
    That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.
</p>
<p>
Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it<br>
    So that the splendour of her laughing eyes<br>
    My single mind on many things divided.
</p>
<p>
Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,<br>
    Make us a centre and themselves a circle,<br>
    More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.
</p>
<p>
Thus girt about the daughter of Latona<br>
    We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,<br>
    So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.
</p>
<p>
Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,<br>
    Are many jewels found, so fair and precious<br>
    They cannot be transported from the realm;
</p>
<p>
And of them was the singing of those lights.<br>
    Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,<br>
    The tidings thence may from the dumb await!
</p>
<p>
As soon as singing thus those burning suns<br>
    Had round about us whirled themselves three times,<br>
    Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,
</p>
<p>
Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released,<br>
    But who stop short, in silence listening<br>
    Till they have gathered the new melody.
</p>
<p>
And within one I heard beginning: “When<br>
    The radiance of grace, by which is kindled<br>
    True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,
</p>
<p>
Within thee multiplied is so resplendent<br>
    That it conducts thee upward by that stair,<br>
    Where without reascending none descends,
</p>
<p>
Who should deny the wine out of his vial<br>
    Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not<br>
    Except as water which descends not seaward.
</p>
<p>
Fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered<br>
    This garland that encircles with delight<br>
    The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.
</p>
<p>
Of the lambs was I of the holy flock<br>
    Which Dominic conducteth by a road<br>
    Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.
</p>
<p>
He who is nearest to me on the right<br>
    My brother and master was; and he Albertus<br>
    Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.
</p>
<p>
If thou of all the others wouldst be certain,<br>
    Follow behind my speaking with thy sight<br>
    Upward along the blessed garland turning.
</p>
<p>
That next effulgence issues from the smile<br>
    Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts<br>
    In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.
</p>
<p>
The other which near by adorns our choir<br>
    That Peter was who, e’en as the poor widow,<br>
    Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.
</p>
<p>
The fifth light, that among us is the fairest,<br>
    Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world<br>
    Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.
</p>
<p>
Within it is the lofty mind, where knowledge<br>
    So deep was put, that, if the true be true,<br>
    To see so much there never rose a second.
</p>
<p>
Thou seest next the lustre of that taper,<br>
    Which in the flesh below looked most within<br>
    The angelic nature and its ministry.
</p>
<p>
Within that other little light is smiling<br>
    The advocate of the Christian centuries,<br>
    Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.
</p>
<p>
Now if thou trainest thy mind’s eye along<br>
    From light to light pursuant of my praise,<br>
    With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest.
</p>
<p>
By seeing every good therein exults<br>
    The sainted soul, which the fallacious world<br>
    Makes manifest to him who listeneth well;
</p>
<p>
The body whence ’twas hunted forth is lying<br>
    Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom<br>
    And banishment it came unto this peace.
</p>
<p>
See farther onward flame the burning breath<br>
    Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard<br>
    Who was in contemplation more than man.
</p>
<p>
This, whence to me returneth thy regard,<br>
    The light is of a spirit unto whom<br>
    In his grave meditations death seemed slow.
</p>
<p>
It is the light eternal of Sigier,<br>
    Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,<br>
    Did syllogize invidious verities.”
</p>
<p>
Then, as a horologe that calleth us<br>
    What time the Bride of God is rising up<br>
    With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,
</p>
<p>
Wherein one part the other draws and urges,<br>
    Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,<br>
    That swells with love the spirit well disposed,
</p>
<p>
Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,<br>
    And render voice to voice, in modulation<br>
    And sweetness that can not be comprehended,
</p>
<p>
Excepting there where joy is made eternal.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XI">
<p>
O Thou insensate care of mortal men,<br>
    How inconclusive are the syllogisms<br>
    That make thee beat thy wings in downward flight!
</p>
<p>
One after laws and one to aphorisms<br>
    Was going, and one following the priesthood,<br>
    And one to reign by force or sophistry,
</p>
<p>
And one in theft, and one in state affairs,<br>
    One in the pleasures of the flesh involved<br>
    Wearied himself, one gave himself to ease;
</p>
<p>
When I, from all these things emancipate,<br>
    With Beatrice above there in the Heavens<br>
    With such exceeding glory was received!
</p>
<p>
When each one had returned unto that point<br>
    Within the circle where it was before,<br>
    It stood as in a candlestick a candle;
</p>
<p>
And from within the effulgence which at first<br>
    Had spoken unto me, I heard begin<br>
    Smiling while it more luminous became:
</p>
<p>
“Even as I am kindled in its ray,<br>
    So, looking into the Eternal Light,<br>
    The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend.
</p>
<p>
Thou doubtest, and wouldst have me to resift<br>
    In language so extended and so open<br>
    My speech, that to thy sense it may be plain,
</p>
<p>
Where just before I said, ‘where well one fattens,’<br>
    And where I said, ‘there never rose a second;’<br>
    And here ’tis needful we distinguish well.
</p>
<p>
The Providence, which governeth the world<br>
    With counsel, wherein all created vision<br>
    Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom,
</p>
<p>
(So that towards her own Beloved might go<br>
    The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry,<br>
    Espoused her with his consecrated blood,
</p>
<p>
Self-confident and unto Him more faithful,)<br>
    Two Princes did ordain in her behoof,<br>
    Which on this side and that might be her guide.
</p>
<p>
The one was all seraphical in ardour;<br>
    The other by his wisdom upon earth<br>
    A splendour was of light cherubical.
</p>
<p>
One will I speak of, for of both is spoken<br>
    In praising one, whichever may be taken,<br>
    Because unto one end their labours were.
</p>
<p>
Between Tupino and the stream that falls<br>
    Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald,<br>
    A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs,
</p>
<p>
From which Perugia feels the cold and heat<br>
    Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep<br>
    Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.
</p>
<p>
From out that slope, there where it breaketh most<br>
    Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun<br>
    As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;
</p>
<p>
Therefore let him who speaketh of that place,<br>
    Say not Ascesi, for he would say little,<br>
    But Orient, if he properly would speak.
</p>
<p>
He was not yet far distant from his rising<br>
    Before he had begun to make the earth<br>
    Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.
</p>
<p>
For he in youth his father’s wrath incurred<br>
    For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,<br>
    The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;
</p>
<p>
And was before his spiritual court<br>
    ‘Et coram patre’ unto her united;<br>
    Then day by day more fervently he loved her.
</p>
<p>
She, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,<br>
    One thousand and one hundred years and more,<br>
    Waited without a suitor till he came.
</p>
<p>
Naught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas<br>
    Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice<br>
    He who struck terror into all the world;
</p>
<p>
Naught it availed being constant and undaunted,<br>
    So that, when Mary still remained below,<br>
    She mounted up with Christ upon the cross.
</p>
<p>
But that too darkly I may not proceed,<br>
    Francis and Poverty for these two lovers<br>
    Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse.
</p>
<p>
Their concord and their joyous semblances,<br>
    The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard,<br>
    They made to be the cause of holy thoughts;
</p>
<p>
So much so that the venerable Bernard<br>
    First bared his feet, and after so great peace<br>
    Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow.
</p>
<p>
O wealth unknown! O veritable good!<br>
    Giles bares his feet, and bares his feet Sylvester<br>
    Behind the bridegroom, so doth please the bride!
</p>
<p>
Then goes his way that father and that master,<br>
    He and his Lady and that family<br>
    Which now was girding on the humble cord;
</p>
<p>
Nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow<br>
    At being son of Peter Bernardone,<br>
    Nor for appearing marvellously scorned;
</p>
<p>
But regally his hard determination<br>
    To Innocent he opened, and from him<br>
    Received the primal seal upon his Order.
</p>
<p>
After the people mendicant increased<br>
    Behind this man, whose admirable life<br>
    Better in glory of the heavens were sung,
</p>
<p>
Incoronated with a second crown<br>
    Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit<br>
    The holy purpose of this Archimandrite.
</p>
<p>
And when he had, through thirst of martyrdom,<br>
    In the proud presence of the Sultan preached<br>
    Christ and the others who came after him,
</p>
<p>
And, finding for conversion too unripe<br>
    The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,<br>
    Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,
</p>
<p>
On the rude rock ’twixt Tiber and the Arno<br>
    From Christ did he receive the final seal,<br>
    Which during two whole years his members bore.
</p>
<p>
When He, who chose him unto so much good,<br>
    Was pleased to draw him up to the reward<br>
    That he had merited by being lowly,
</p>
<p>
Unto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,<br>
    His most dear Lady did he recommend,<br>
    And bade that they should love her faithfully;
</p>
<p>
And from her bosom the illustrious soul<br>
    Wished to depart, returning to its realm,<br>
    And for its body wished no other bier.
</p>
<p>
Think now what man was he, who was a fit<br>
    Companion over the high seas to keep<br>
    The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.
</p>
<p>
And this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever<br>
    Doth follow him as he commands can see<br>
    That he is laden with good merchandise.
</p>
<p>
But for new pasturage his flock has grown<br>
    So greedy, that it is impossible<br>
    They be not scattered over fields diverse;
</p>
<p>
And in proportion as his sheep remote<br>
    And vagabond go farther off from him,<br>
    More void of milk return they to the fold.
</p>
<p>
Verily some there are that fear a hurt,<br>
    And keep close to the shepherd; but so few,<br>
    That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods.
</p>
<p>
Now if my utterance be not indistinct,<br>
    If thine own hearing hath attentive been,<br>
    If thou recall to mind what I have said,
</p>
<p>
In part contented shall thy wishes be;<br>
    For thou shalt see the plant that’s chipped away,<br>
    And the rebuke that lieth in the words,
</p>
<p>
‘Where well one fattens, if he strayeth not.’”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XII">
<p>
Soon as the blessed flame had taken up<br>
    The final word to give it utterance,<br>
    Began the holy millstone to revolve,
</p>
<p>
And in its gyre had not turned wholly round,<br>
    Before another in a ring enclosed it,<br>
    And motion joined to motion, song to song;
</p>
<p>
Song that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,<br>
    Our Sirens, in those dulcet clarions,<br>
    As primal splendour that which is reflected.
</p>
<p>
And as are spanned athwart a tender cloud<br>
    Two rainbows parallel and like in colour,<br>
    When Juno to her handmaid gives command,
</p>
<p>
(The one without born of the one within,<br>
    Like to the speaking of that vagrant one<br>
    Whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,)
</p>
<p>
And make the people here, through covenant<br>
    God set with Noah, presageful of the world<br>
    That shall no more be covered with a flood,
</p>
<p>
In such wise of those sempiternal roses<br>
    The garlands twain encompassed us about,<br>
    And thus the outer to the inner answered.
</p>
<p>
After the dance, and other grand rejoicings,<br>
    Both of the singing, and the flaming forth<br>
    Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender,
</p>
<p>
Together, at once, with one accord had stopped,<br>
    (Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them,<br>
    Must needs together shut and lift themselves,)
</p>
<p>
Out of the heart of one of the new lights<br>
    There came a voice, that needle to the star<br>
    Made me appear in turning thitherward.
</p>
<p>
And it began: “The love that makes me fair<br>
    Draws me to speak about the other leader,<br>
    By whom so well is spoken here of mine.
</p>
<p>
’Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other,<br>
    That, as they were united in their warfare,<br>
    Together likewise may their glory shine.
</p>
<p>
The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost<br>
    So dear to arm again, behind the standard<br>
    Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,
</p>
<p>
When the Emperor who reigneth evermore<br>
    Provided for the host that was in peril,<br>
    Through grace alone and not that it was worthy;
</p>
<p>
And, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour<br>
    With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word<br>
    The straggling people were together drawn.
</p>
<p>
Within that region where the sweet west wind<br>
    Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith<br>
    Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh,
</p>
<p>
Not far off from the beating of the waves,<br>
    Behind which in his long career the sun<br>
    Sometimes conceals himself from every man,
</p>
<p>
Is situate the fortunate Calahorra,<br>
    Under protection of the mighty shield<br>
    In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.
</p>
<p>
Therein was born the amorous paramour<br>
    Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,<br>
    Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;
</p>
<p>
And when it was created was his mind<br>
    Replete with such a living energy,<br>
    That in his mother her it made prophetic.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the espousals were complete<br>
    Between him and the Faith at holy font,<br>
    Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,
</p>
<p>
The woman, who for him had given assent,<br>
    Saw in a dream the admirable fruit<br>
    That issue would from him and from his heirs;
</p>
<p>
And that he might be construed as he was,<br>
    A spirit from this place went forth to name him<br>
    With His possessive whose he wholly was.
</p>
<p>
Dominic was he called; and him I speak of<br>
    Even as of the husbandman whom Christ<br>
    Elected to his garden to assist him.
</p>
<p>
Envoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,<br>
    For the first love made manifest in him<br>
    Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.
</p>
<p>
Silent and wakeful many a time was he<br>
    Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,<br>
    As if he would have said, ‘For this I came.’
</p>
<p>
O thou his father, Felix verily!<br>
    O thou his mother, verily Joanna,<br>
    If this, interpreted, means as is said!
</p>
<p>
Not for the world which people toil for now<br>
    In following Ostiense and Taddeo,<br>
    But through his longing after the true manna,
</p>
<p>
He in short time became so great a teacher,<br>
    That he began to go about the vineyard,<br>
    Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;
</p>
<p>
And of the See, (that once was more benignant<br>
    Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,<br>
    But him who sits there and degenerates,)
</p>
<p>
Not to dispense or two or three for six,<br>
    Not any fortune of first vacancy,<br>
    ‘Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,’
</p>
<p>
He asked for, but against the errant world<br>
    Permission to do battle for the seed,<br>
    Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.
</p>
<p>
Then with the doctrine and the will together,<br>
    With office apostolical he moved,<br>
    Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;
</p>
<p>
And in among the shoots heretical<br>
    His impetus with greater fury smote,<br>
    Wherever the resistance was the greatest.
</p>
<p>
Of him were made thereafter divers runnels,<br>
    Whereby the garden catholic is watered,<br>
    So that more living its plantations stand.
</p>
<p>
If such the one wheel of the Biga was,<br>
    In which the Holy Church itself defended<br>
    And in the field its civic battle won,
</p>
<p>
Truly full manifest should be to thee<br>
    The excellence of the other, unto whom<br>
    Thomas so courteous was before my coming.
</p>
<p>
But still the orbit, which the highest part<br>
    Of its circumference made, is derelict,<br>
    So that the mould is where was once the crust.
</p>
<p>
His family, that had straight forward moved<br>
    With feet upon his footprints, are turned round<br>
    So that they set the point upon the heel.

And soon aware they will be of the harvest<br>
    Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares<br>

Yet say I, he who searcheth leaf by leaf<br>
    Our volume through, would still some page discover<br>

’Twill not be from Casal nor Acquasparta,<br>

Here are Illuminato and Agostino,<br>

And with me they have moved this company.”

<p>
Let him imagine, who would well conceive<br>
    What now I saw, and let him while I speak<br>
    Retain the image as a steadfast rock,
</p>
<p>
The fifteen stars, that in their divers regions<br>
    The sky enliven with a light so great<br>
    That it transcends all clusters of the air;
</p>
<p>
Let him the Wain imagine unto which<br>
    Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,<br>
    So that in turning of its pole it fails not;
</p>
<p>
Let him the mouth imagine of the horn<br>
    That in the point beginneth of the axis<br>
    Round about which the primal wheel revolves,—
</p>
<p>
To have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,<br>
    Like unto that which Minos’ daughter made,<br>
    The moment when she felt the frost of death;
</p>
<p>
And one to have its rays within the other,<br>
    And both to whirl themselves in such a manner<br>
    That one should forward go, the other backward;
</p>
<p>
And he will have some shadowing forth of that<br>
    True constellation and the double dance<br>
    That circled round the point at which I was;
</p>
<p>
Because it is as much beyond our wont,<br>
    As swifter than the motion of the Chiana<br>
    Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.
</p>
<p>
There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,<br>
    But in the divine nature Persons three,<br>
    And in one person the divine and human.
</p>
<p>
The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,<br>
    And unto us those holy lights gave need,<br>
    Growing in happiness from care to care.
</p>
<p>
Then broke the silence of those saints concordant<br>
    The light in which the admirable life<br>
    Of God’s own mendicant was told to me,
</p>
<p>
And said: “Now that one straw is trodden out<br>
    Now that its seed is garnered up already,<br>
    Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.
</p>
<p>
Into that bosom, thou believest, whence<br>
    Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek<br>
    Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,
</p>
<p>
And into that which, by the lance transfixed,<br>
    Before and since, such satisfaction made<br>
    That it weighs down the balance of all sin,
</p>
<p>
Whate’er of light it has to human nature<br>
    Been lawful to possess was all infused<br>
    By the same power that both of them created;
</p>
<p>
And hence at what I said above dost wonder,<br>
    When I narrated that no second had<br>
    The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.
</p>
<p>
Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,<br>
    And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse<br>
    Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.
</p>
<p>
That which can die, and that which dieth not,<br>
    Are nothing but the splendour of the idea<br>
    Which by his love our Lord brings into being;
</p>
<p>
Because that living Light, which from its fount<br>
    Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not<br>
    From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,
</p>
<p>
Through its own goodness reunites its rays<br>
    In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,<br>
    Itself eternally remaining One.
</p>
<p>
Thence it descends to the last potencies,<br>
    Downward from act to act becoming such<br>
    That only brief contingencies it makes;
</p>
<p>
And these contingencies I hold to be<br>
    Things generated, which the heaven produces<br>
    By its own motion, with seed and without.
</p>
<p>
Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,<br>
    Remains immutable, and hence beneath<br>
    The ideal signet more and less shines through;
</p>
<p>
Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree<br>
    After its kind bears worse and better fruit,<br>
    And ye are born with characters diverse.
</p>
<p>
If in perfection tempered were the wax,<br>
    And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,<br>
    The brilliance of the seal would all appear;
</p>
<p>
But nature gives it evermore deficient,<br>
    In the like manner working as the artist,<br>
    Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.
</p>
<p>
If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,<br>
    Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,<br>
    Perfection absolute is there acquired.
</p>
<p>
Thus was of old the earth created worthy<br>
    Of all and every animal perfection;<br>
    And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;
</p>
<p>
So that thine own opinion I commend,<br>
    That human nature never yet has been,<br>
    Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.
</p>
<p>
Now if no farther forth I should proceed,<br>
    ‘Then in what way was he without a peer?’<br>
    Would be the first beginning of thy words.
</p>
<p>
But, that may well appear what now appears not,<br>
    Think who he was, and what occasion moved him<br>
    To make request, when it was told him, ‘Ask.’
</p>
<p>
I’ve not so spoken that thou canst not see<br>
    Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,<br>
    That he might be sufficiently a king;
</p>
<p>
’Twas not to know the number in which are<br>
    The motors here above, or if ‘necesse’<br>
    With a contingent e’er ‘necesse’ make,
</p>
<p>
‘Non si est dare primum motum esse,’<br>
    Or if in semicircle can be made<br>
    Triangle so that it have no right angle.
</p>
<p>
Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,<br>
    A regal prudence is that peerless seeing<br>
    In which the shaft of my intention strikes.
</p>
<p>
And if on ‘rose’ thou turnest thy clear eyes,<br>
    Thou’lt see that it has reference alone<br>
    To kings who’re many, and the good are rare.
</p>
<p>
With this distinction take thou what I said,<br>
    And thus it can consist with thy belief<br>
    Of the first father and of our Delight.
</p>
<p>
And lead shall this be always to thy feet,<br>
    To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly<br>
    Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;
</p>
<p>
For very low among the fools is he<br>
    Who affirms without distinction, or denies,<br>
    As well in one as in the other case;
</p>
<p>
Because it happens that full often bends<br>
    Current opinion in the false direction,<br>
    And then the feelings bind the intellect.
</p>
<p>
Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,<br>
    (Since he returneth not the same he went,)<br>
    Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;
</p>
<p>
And in the world proofs manifest thereof<br>
    Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,<br>
    And many who went on and knew not whither;
</p>
<p>
Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools<br>
    Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures<br>
    In rendering distorted their straight faces.
</p>
<p>
Nor yet shall people be too confident<br>
    In judging, even as he is who doth count<br>
    The corn in field or ever it be ripe.
</p>
<p>
For I have seen all winter long the thorn<br>
    First show itself intractable and fierce,<br>
    And after bear the rose upon its top;
</p>
<p>
And I have seen a ship direct and swift<br>
    Run o’er the sea throughout its course entire,<br>
    To perish at the harbour’s mouth at last.
</p>
<p>
Let not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,<br>
    Seeing one steal, another offering make,<br>
    To see them in the arbitrament divine;
</p>
<p>
For one may rise, and fall the other may.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XIV">
<p>
From centre unto rim, from rim to centre,<br>
    In a round vase the water moves itself,<br>
    As from without ’tis struck or from within.
</p>
<p>
Into my mind upon a sudden dropped<br>
    What I am saying, at the moment when<br>
    Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,
</p>
<p>
Because of the resemblance that was born<br>
    Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,<br>
    Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:
</p>
<p>
“This man has need (and does not tell you so,<br>
    Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)<br>
    Of going to the root of one truth more.
</p>
<p>
Declare unto him if the light wherewith<br>
    Blossoms your substance shall remain with you<br>
    Eternally the same that it is now;
</p>
<p>
And if it do remain, say in what manner,<br>
    After ye are again made visible,<br>
    It can be that it injure not your sight.”
</p>
<p>
As by a greater gladness urged and drawn<br>
    They who are dancing in a ring sometimes<br>
    Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;
</p>
<p>
So, at that orison devout and prompt,<br>
    The holy circles a new joy displayed<br>
    In their revolving and their wondrous song.
</p>
<p>
Whoso lamenteth him that here we die<br>
    That we may live above, has never there<br>
    Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.
</p>
<p>
The One and Two and Three who ever liveth,<br>
    And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,<br>
    Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,
</p>
<p>
Three several times was chanted by each one<br>
    Among those spirits, with such melody<br>
    That for all merit it were just reward;
</p>
<p>
And, in the lustre most divine of all<br>
    The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,<br>
    Such as perhaps the Angel’s was to Mary,
</p>
<p>
Answer: “As long as the festivity<br>
    Of Paradise shall be, so long our love<br>
    Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.
</p>
<p>
Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,<br>
    The ardour to the vision; and the vision<br>
    Equals what grace it has above its worth.
</p>
<p>
When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh<br>
    Is reassumed, then shall our persons be<br>
    More pleasing by their being all complete;
</p>
<p>
For will increase whate’er bestows on us<br>
    Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,<br>
    Light which enables us to look on Him;
</p>
<p>
Therefore the vision must perforce increase,<br>
    Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,<br>
    Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.
</p>
<p>
But even as a coal that sends forth flame,<br>
    And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it<br>
    So that its own appearance it maintains,
</p>
<p>
Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now<br>
    Shall be o’erpowered in aspect by the flesh,<br>
    Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;
</p>
<p>
Nor can so great a splendour weary us,<br>
    For strong will be the organs of the body<br>
    To everything which hath the power to please us.”
</p>
<p>
So sudden and alert appeared to me<br>
    Both one and the other choir to say Amen,<br>
    That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;
</p>
<p>
Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,<br>
    The fathers, and the rest who had been dear<br>
    Or ever they became eternal flames.
</p>
<p>
And lo! all round about of equal brightness<br>
    Arose a lustre over what was there,<br>
    Like an horizon that is clearing up.
</p>
<p>
And as at rise of early eve begin<br>
    Along the welkin new appearances,<br>
    So that the sight seems real and unreal,
</p>
<p>
It seemed to me that new subsistences<br>
    Began there to be seen, and make a circle<br>
    Outside the other two circumferences.
</p>
<p>
O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,<br>
    How sudden and incandescent it became<br>
    Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!
</p>
<p>
But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling<br>
    Appeared to me, that with the other sights<br>
    That followed not my memory I must leave her.
</p>
<p>
Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed<br>
    The power, and I beheld myself translated<br>
    To higher salvation with my Lady only.
</p>
<p>
Well was I ware that I was more uplifted<br>
    By the enkindled smiling of the star,<br>
    That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.
</p>
<p>
With all my heart, and in that dialect<br>
    Which is the same in all, such holocaust<br>
    To God I made as the new grace beseemed;
</p>
<p>
And not yet from my bosom was exhausted<br>
    The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew<br>
    This offering was accepted and auspicious;
</p>
<p>
For with so great a lustre and so red<br>
    Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,<br>
    I said: “O Helios who dost so adorn them!”
</p>
<p>
Even as distinct with less and greater lights<br>
    Glimmers between the two poles of the world<br>
    The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,
</p>
<p>
Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,<br>
    Those rays described the venerable sign<br>
    That quadrants joining in a circle make.
</p>
<p>
Here doth my memory overcome my genius;<br>
    For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,<br>
    So that I cannot find ensample worthy;
</p>
<p>
But he who takes his cross and follows Christ<br>
    Again will pardon me what I omit,<br>
    Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.
</p>
<p>
From horn to horn, and ’twixt the top and base,<br>
    Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating<br>
    As they together met and passed each other;
</p>
<p>
Thus level and aslant and swift and slow<br>
    We here behold, renewing still the sight,<br>
    The particles of bodies long and short,
</p>
<p>
Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed<br>
    Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence<br>
    People with cunning and with art contrive.
</p>
<p>
And as a lute and harp, accordant strung<br>
    With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make<br>
    To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,
</p>
<p>
So from the lights that there to me appeared<br>
    Upgathered through the cross a melody,<br>
    Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.
</p>
<p>
Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,<br>
    Because there came to me, “Arise and conquer!”<br>
    As unto him who hears and comprehends not.
</p>
<p>
So much enamoured I became therewith,<br>
    That until then there was not anything<br>
    That e’er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,<br>
    Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,<br>
    Into which gazing my desire has rest;
</p>
<p>
But who bethinks him that the living seals<br>
    Of every beauty grow in power ascending,<br>
    And that I there had not turned round to those,
</p>
<p>
Can me excuse, if I myself accuse<br>
    To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:<br>
    For here the holy joy is not disclosed,
</p>
<p>
Because ascending it becomes more pure.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XV">
<p>
A will benign, in which reveals itself<br>
    Ever the love that righteously inspires,<br>
    As in the iniquitous, cupidity,
</p>
<p>
Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre,<br>
    And quieted the consecrated chords,<br>
    That Heaven’s right hand doth tighten and relax.
</p>
<p>
How unto just entreaties shall be deaf<br>
    Those substances, which, to give me desire<br>
    Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?
</p>
<p>
’Tis well that without end he should lament,<br>
    Who for the love of thing that doth not last<br>
    Eternally despoils him of that love!
</p>
<p>
As through the pure and tranquil evening air<br>
    There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,<br>
    Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,
</p>
<p>
And seems to be a star that changeth place,<br>
    Except that in the part where it is kindled<br>
    Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;
</p>
<p>
So from the horn that to the right extends<br>
    Unto that cross’s foot there ran a star<br>
    Out of the constellation shining there;
</p>
<p>
Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,<br>
    But down the radiant fillet ran along,<br>
    So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.
</p>
<p>
Thus piteous did Anchises’ shade reach forward,<br>
    If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,<br>
    When in Elysium he his son perceived.
</p>
<p>
“O sanguis meus, O superinfusa<br>
    Gratia Dei, sicut tibi, cui<br>
    Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa?”
</p>
<p>
Thus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;<br>
    Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,<br>
    And on this side and that was stupefied;
</p>
<p>
For in her eyes was burning such a smile<br>
    That with mine own methought I touched the bottom<br>
    Both of my grace and of my Paradise!
</p>
<p>
Then, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,<br>
    The spirit joined to its beginning things<br>
    I understood not, so profound it spake;
</p>
<p>
Nor did it hide itself from me by choice,<br>
    But by necessity; for its conception<br>
    Above the mark of mortals set itself.
</p>
<p>
And when the bow of burning sympathy<br>
    Was so far slackened, that its speech descended<br>
    Towards the mark of our intelligence,
</p>
<p>
The first thing that was understood by me<br>
    Was “Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,<br>
    Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!”
</p>
<p>
And it continued: “Hunger long and grateful,<br>
    Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume<br>
    Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,
</p>
<p>
Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light<br>
    In which I speak to thee, by grace of her<br>
    Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.
</p>
<p>
Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass<br>
    From Him who is the first, as from the unit,<br>
    If that be known, ray out the five and six;
</p>
<p>
And therefore who I am thou askest not,<br>
    And why I seem more joyous unto thee<br>
    Than any other of this gladsome crowd.
</p>
<p>
Thou think’st the truth; because the small and great<br>
    Of this existence look into the mirror<br>
    Wherein, before thou think’st, thy thought thou showest.
</p>
<p>
But that the sacred love, in which I watch<br>
    With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst<br>
    With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,
</p>
<p>
Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad<br>
    Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,<br>
    To which my answer is decreed already.”
</p>
<p>
To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard<br>
    Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,<br>
    That made the wings of my desire increase;
</p>
<p>
Then in this wise began I: “Love and knowledge,<br>
    When on you dawned the first Equality,<br>
    Of the same weight for each of you became;
</p>
<p>
For in the Sun, which lighted you and burned<br>
    With heat and radiance, they so equal are,<br>
    That all similitudes are insufficient.
</p>
<p>
But among mortals will and argument,<br>
    For reason that to you is manifest,<br>
    Diversely feathered in their pinions are.
</p>
<p>
Whence I, who mortal am, feel in myself<br>
    This inequality; so give not thanks,<br>
    Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome.
</p>
<p>
Truly do I entreat thee, living topaz!<br>
    Set in this precious jewel as a gem,<br>
    That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name.”
</p>
<p>
“O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took<br>
    E’en while awaiting, I was thine own root!”<br>
    Such a beginning he in answer made me.
</p>
<p>
Then said to me: “That one from whom is named<br>
    Thy race, and who a hundred years and more<br>
    Has circled round the mount on the first cornice,
</p>
<p>
A son of mine and thy great-grandsire was;<br>
    Well it behoves thee that the long fatigue<br>
    Thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works.
</p>
<p>
Florence, within the ancient boundary<br>
    From which she taketh still her tierce and nones,<br>
    Abode in quiet, temperate and chaste.
</p>
<p>
No golden chain she had, nor coronal,<br>
    Nor ladies shod with sandal shoon, nor girdle<br>
    That caught the eye more than the person did.
</p>
<p>
Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear<br>
    Into the father, for the time and dower<br>
    Did not o’errun this side or that the measure.
</p>
<p>
No houses had she void of families,<br>
    Not yet had thither come Sardanapalus<br>
    To show what in a chamber can be done;
</p>
<p>
Not yet surpassed had Montemalo been<br>
    By your Uccellatojo, which surpassed<br>
    Shall in its downfall be as in its rise.
</p>
<p>
Bellincion Berti saw I go begirt<br>
    With leather and with bone, and from the mirror<br>
    His dame depart without a painted face;
</p>
<p>
And him of Nerli saw, and him of Vecchio,<br>
    Contented with their simple suits of buff<br>
    And with the spindle and the flax their dames.
</p>
<p>
O fortunate women! and each one was certain<br>
    Of her own burial-place, and none as yet<br>
    For sake of France was in her bed deserted.
</p>
<p>
One o’er the cradle kept her studious watch,<br>
    And in her lullaby the language used<br>
    That first delights the fathers and the mothers;
</p>
<p>
Another, drawing tresses from her distaff,<br>
    Told o’er among her family the tales<br>
    Of Trojans and of Fesole and Rome.
</p>
<p>
As great a marvel then would have been held<br>
    A Lapo Salterello, a Cianghella,<br>
    As Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.
</p>
<p>
To such a quiet, such a beautiful<br>
    Life of the citizen, to such a safe<br>
    Community, and to so sweet an inn,
</p>
<p>
Did Mary give me, with loud cries invoked,<br>
    And in your ancient Baptistery at once<br>
    Christian and Cacciaguida I became.
</p>
<p>
Moronto was my brother, and Eliseo;<br>
    From Val di Pado came to me my wife,<br>
    And from that place thy surname was derived.
</p>
<p>
I followed afterward the Emperor Conrad,<br>
    And he begirt me of his chivalry,<br>
    So much I pleased him with my noble deeds.
</p>
<p>
I followed in his train against that law’s<br>
    Iniquity, whose people doth usurp<br>
    Your just possession, through your Pastor’s fault.
</p>
<p>
There by that execrable race was I<br>
    Released from bonds of the fallacious world,<br>
    The love of which defileth many souls,
</p>
<p>
And came from martyrdom unto this peace.”

<p>
O thou our poor nobility of blood,<br>
    If thou dost make the people glory in thee<br>
    Down here where our affection languishes,
</p>
<p>
A marvellous thing it ne’er will be to me;<br>
    For there where appetite is not perverted,<br>
    I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast!
</p>
<p>
Truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,<br>
    So that unless we piece thee day by day<br>
    Time goeth round about thee with his shears!
</p>
<p>
With ‘You,’ which Rome was first to tolerate,<br>
    (Wherein her family less perseveres,)<br>
    Yet once again my words beginning made;
</p>
<p>
Whence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart,<br>
    Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed<br>
    At the first failing writ of Guenever.
</p>
<p>
And I began: “You are my ancestor,<br>
    You give to me all hardihood to speak,<br>
    You lift me so that I am more than I.
</p>
<p>
So many rivulets with gladness fill<br>
    My mind, that of itself it makes a joy<br>
    Because it can endure this and not burst.
</p>
<p>
Then tell me, my beloved root ancestral,<br>
    Who were your ancestors, and what the years<br>
    That in your boyhood chronicled themselves?
</p>
<p>
Tell me about the sheepfold of Saint John,<br>
    How large it was, and who the people were<br>
    Within it worthy of the highest seats.”
</p>
<p>
As at the blowing of the winds a coal<br>
    Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light<br>
    Become resplendent at my blandishments.
</p>
<p>
And as unto mine eyes it grew more fair,<br>
    With voice more sweet and tender, but not in<br>
    This modern dialect, it said to me:
</p>
<p>
“From uttering of the ‘Ave,’ till the birth<br>
    In which my mother, who is now a saint,<br>
    Of me was lightened who had been her burden,
</p>
<p>
Unto its Lion had this fire returned<br>
    Five hundred fifty times and thirty more,<br>
    To reinflame itself beneath his paw.
</p>
<p>
My ancestors and I our birthplace had<br>
    Where first is found the last ward of the city<br>
    By him who runneth in your annual game.
</p>
<p>
Suffice it of my elders to hear this;<br>
    But who they were, and whence they thither came,<br>
    Silence is more considerate than speech.
</p>
<p>
All those who at that time were there between<br>
    Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms,<br>
    Were a fifth part of those who now are living;
</p>
<p>
But the community, that now is mixed<br>
    With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine,<br>
    Pure in the lowest artisan was seen.
</p>
<p>
O how much better ’twere to have as neighbours<br>
    The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo<br>
    And at Trespiano have your boundary,
</p>
<p>
Than have them in the town, and bear the stench<br>
    Of Aguglione’s churl, and him of Signa<br>
    Who has sharp eyes for trickery already.
</p>
<p>
Had not the folk, which most of all the world<br>
    Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar,<br>
    But as a mother to her son benignant,
</p>
<p>
Some who turn Florentines, and trade and discount,<br>
    Would have gone back again to Simifonte<br>
    There where their grandsires went about as beggars.
</p>
<p>
At Montemurlo still would be the Counts,<br>
    The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,<br>
    Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.
</p>
<p>
Ever the intermingling of the people<br>
    Has been the source of malady in cities,<br>
    As in the body food it surfeits on;
</p>
<p>
And a blind bull more headlong plunges down<br>
    Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts<br>
    Better and more a single sword than five.
</p>
<p>
If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,<br>
    How they have passed away, and how are passing<br>
    Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,
</p>
<p>
To hear how races waste themselves away,<br>
    Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,<br>
    Seeing that even cities have an end.
</p>
<p>
All things of yours have their mortality,<br>
    Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some<br>
    That a long while endure, and lives are short;
</p>
<p>
And as the turning of the lunar heaven<br>
    Covers and bares the shores without a pause,<br>
    In the like manner fortune does with Florence.
</p>
<p>
Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing<br>
    What I shall say of the great Florentines<br>
    Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.
</p>
<p>
I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,<br>
    Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,<br>
    Even in their fall illustrious citizens;
</p>
<p>
And saw, as mighty as they ancient were,<br>
    With him of La Sannella him of Arca,<br>
    And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.
</p>
<p>
Near to the gate that is at present laden<br>
    With a new felony of so much weight<br>
    That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,
</p>
<p>
The Ravignani were, from whom descended<br>
    The County Guido, and whoe’er the name<br>
    Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.
</p>
<p>
He of La Pressa knew the art of ruling<br>
    Already, and already Galigajo<br>
    Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.
</p>
<p>
Mighty already was the Column Vair,<br>
    Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,<br>
    And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.
</p>
<p>
The stock from which were the Calfucci born<br>
    Was great already, and already chosen<br>
    To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.
</p>
<p>
O how beheld I those who are undone<br>
    By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold<br>
    Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!
</p>
<p>
So likewise did the ancestors of those<br>
    Who evermore, when vacant is your church,<br>
    Fatten by staying in consistory.
</p>
<p>
The insolent race, that like a dragon follows<br>
    Whoever flees, and unto him that shows<br>
    His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,
</p>
<p>
Already rising was, but from low people;<br>
    So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato<br>
    That his wife’s father should make him their kin.
</p>
<p>
Already had Caponsacco to the Market<br>
    From Fesole descended, and already<br>
    Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.
</p>
<p>
I’ll tell a thing incredible, but true;<br>
    One entered the small circuit by a gate<br>
    Which from the Della Pera took its name!
</p>
<p>
Each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon<br>
    Of the great baron whose renown and name<br>
    The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,
</p>
<p>
Knighthood and privilege from him received;<br>
    Though with the populace unites himself<br>
    To-day the man who binds it with a border.
</p>
<p>
Already were Gualterotti and Importuni;<br>
    And still more quiet would the Borgo be<br>
    If with new neighbours it remained unfed.
</p>
<p>
The house from which is born your lamentation,<br>
    Through just disdain that death among you brought<br>
    And put an end unto your joyous life,
</p>
<p>
Was honoured in itself and its companions.<br>
    O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour<br>
    Thou fled’st the bridal at another’s promptings!
</p>
<p>
Many would be rejoicing who are sad,<br>
    If God had thee surrendered to the Ema<br>
    The first time that thou camest to the city.
</p>
<p>
But it behoved the mutilated stone<br>
    Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide<br>
    A victim in her latest hour of peace.
</p>
<p>
With all these families, and others with them,<br>
    Florence beheld I in so great repose,<br>
    That no occasion had she whence to weep;
</p>
<p>
With all these families beheld so just<br>
    And glorious her people, that the lily<br>
    Never upon the spear was placed reversed,
</p>
<p>
Nor by division was vermilion made.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XVII">
<p>
As came to Clymene, to be made certain<br>
    Of that which he had heard against himself,<br>
    He who makes fathers chary still to children,
</p>
<p>
Even such was I, and such was I perceived<br>
    By Beatrice and by the holy light<br>
    That first on my account had changed its place.
</p>
<p>
Therefore my Lady said to me: “Send forth<br>
    The flame of thy desire, so that it issue<br>
    Imprinted well with the internal stamp;
</p>
<p>
Not that our knowledge may be greater made<br>
    By speech of thine, but to accustom thee<br>
    To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink.”
</p>
<p>
“O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,<br>
    That even as minds terrestrial perceive<br>
    No triangle containeth two obtuse,
</p>
<p>
So thou beholdest the contingent things<br>
    Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes<br>
    Upon the point in which all times are present,)
</p>
<p>
While I was with Virgilius conjoined<br>
    Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,<br>
    And when descending into the dead world,
</p>
<p>
Were spoken to me of my future life<br>
    Some grievous words; although I feel myself<br>
    In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.
</p>
<p>
On this account my wish would be content<br>
    To hear what fortune is approaching me,<br>
    Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly.”
</p>
<p>
Thus did I say unto that selfsame light<br>
    That unto me had spoken before; and even<br>
    As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.
</p>
<p>
Not in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk<br>
    Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain<br>
    The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,
</p>
<p>
But with clear words and unambiguous<br>
    Language responded that paternal love,<br>
    Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:
</p>
<p>
“Contingency, that outside of the volume<br>
    Of your materiality extends not,<br>
    Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.
</p>
<p>
Necessity however thence it takes not,<br>
    Except as from the eye, in which ’tis mirrored,<br>
    A ship that with the current down descends.
</p>
<p>
From thence, e’en as there cometh to the ear<br>
    Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight<br>
    To me the time that is preparing for thee.
</p>
<p>
As forth from Athens went Hippolytus,<br>
    By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,<br>
    So thou from Florence must perforce depart.
</p>
<p>
Already this is willed, and this is sought for;<br>
    And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,<br>
    Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.
</p>
<p>
The blame shall follow the offended party<br>
    In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance<br>
    Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.
</p>
<p>
Thou shalt abandon everything beloved<br>
    Most tenderly, and this the arrow is<br>
    Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.
</p>
<p>
Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt<br>
    The bread of others, and how hard a road<br>
    The going down and up another’s stairs.
</p>
<p>
And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders<br>
    Will be the bad and foolish company<br>
    With which into this valley thou shalt fall;
</p>
<p>
For all ingrate, all mad and impious<br>
    Will they become against thee; but soon after<br>
    They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.
</p>
<p>
Of their bestiality their own proceedings<br>
    Shall furnish proof; so ’twill be well for thee<br>
    A party to have made thee by thyself.
</p>
<p>
Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn<br>
    Shall be the mighty Lombard’s courtesy,<br>
    Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,
</p>
<p>
Who such benign regard shall have for thee<br>
    That ’twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,<br>
    That shall be first which is with others last.
</p>
<p>
With him shalt thou see one who at his birth<br>
    Has by this star of strength been so impressed,<br>
    That notable shall his achievements be.
</p>
<p>
Not yet the people are aware of him<br>
    Through his young age, since only nine years yet<br>
    Around about him have these wheels revolved.
</p>
<p>
But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,<br>
    Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear<br>
    In caring not for silver nor for toil.
</p>
<p>
So recognized shall his magnificence<br>
    Become hereafter, that his enemies<br>
    Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.
</p>
<p>
On him rely, and on his benefits;<br>
    By him shall many people be transformed,<br>
    Changing condition rich and mendicant;
</p>
<p>
And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear<br>
    Of him, but shalt not say it”—and things said he<br>
    Incredible to those who shall be present.
</p>
<p>
Then added: “Son, these are the commentaries<br>
    On what was said to thee; behold the snares<br>
    That are concealed behind few revolutions;
</p>
<p>
Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,<br>
    Because thy life into the future reaches<br>
    Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.”
</p>
<p>
When by its silence showed that sainted soul<br>
    That it had finished putting in the woof<br>
    Into that web which I had given it warped,
</p>
<p>
Began I, even as he who yearneth after,<br>
    Being in doubt, some counsel from a person<br>
    Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:
</p>
<p>
“Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on<br>
    The time towards me such a blow to deal me<br>
    As heaviest is to him who most gives way.
</p>
<p>
Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,<br>
    That, if the dearest place be taken from me,<br>
    I may not lose the others by my songs.
</p>
<p>
Down through the world of infinite bitterness,<br>
    And o’er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit<br>
    The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,
</p>
<p>
And afterward through heaven from light to light,<br>
    I have learned that which, if I tell again,<br>
    Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.
</p>
<p>
And if I am a timid friend to truth,<br>
    I fear lest I may lose my life with those<br>
    Who will hereafter call this time the olden.”
</p>
<p>
The light in which was smiling my own treasure<br>
    Which there I had discovered, flashed at first<br>
    As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;
</p>
<p>
Then made reply: “A conscience overcast<br>
    Or with its own or with another’s shame,<br>
    Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;
</p>
<p>
But ne’ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,<br>
    Make manifest thy vision utterly,<br>
    And let them scratch wherever is the itch;
</p>
<p>
For if thine utterance shall offensive be<br>
    At the first taste, a vital nutriment<br>
    ’Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.
</p>
<p>
This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,<br>
    Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,<br>
    And that is no slight argument of honour.
</p>
<p>
Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,<br>
    Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,<br>
    Only the souls that unto fame are known;
</p>
<p>
Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,<br>
    Nor doth confirm its faith by an example<br>
    Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,
</p>
<p>
Or other reason that is not apparent.”
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XVIII">
<p>
Now was alone rejoicing in its word<br>
    That soul beatified, and I was tasting<br>
    My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,
</p>
<p>
And the Lady who to God was leading me<br>
    Said: “Change thy thought; consider that I am<br>
    Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.”
</p>
<p>
Unto the loving accents of my comfort<br>
    I turned me round, and then what love I saw<br>
    Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;
</p>
<p>
Not only that my language I distrust,<br>
    But that my mind cannot return so far<br>
    Above itself, unless another guide it.
</p>
<p>
Thus much upon that point can I repeat,<br>
    That, her again beholding, my affection<br>
    From every other longing was released.
</p>
<p>
While the eternal pleasure, which direct<br>
    Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face<br>
    Contented me with its reflected aspect,
</p>
<p>
Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,<br>
    She said to me, “Turn thee about and listen;<br>
    Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.”
</p>
<p>
Even as sometimes here do we behold<br>
    The affection in the look, if it be such<br>
    That all the soul is wrapt away by it,
</p>
<p>
So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy<br>
    To which I turned, I recognized therein<br>
    The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.
</p>
<p>
And it began: “In this fifth resting-place<br>
    Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,<br>
    And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,
</p>
<p>
Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet<br>
    They came to Heaven, were of such great renown<br>
    That every Muse therewith would affluent be.
</p>
<p>
Therefore look thou upon the cross’s horns;<br>
    He whom I now shall name will there enact<br>
    What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.”
</p>
<p>
I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn<br>
    By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)<br>
    Nor noted I the word before the deed;
</p>
<p>
And at the name of the great Maccabee<br>
    I saw another move itself revolving,<br>
    And gladness was the whip unto that top.
</p>
<p>
Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,<br>
    Two of them my regard attentive followed<br>
    As followeth the eye its falcon flying.
</p>
<p>
William thereafterward, and Renouard,<br>
    And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight<br>
    Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.
</p>
<p>
Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,<br>
    The soul that had addressed me showed how great<br>
    An artist ’twas among the heavenly singers.
</p>
<p>
To my right side I turned myself around,<br>
    My duty to behold in Beatrice<br>
    Either by words or gesture signified;
</p>
<p>
And so translucent I beheld her eyes,<br>
    So full of pleasure, that her countenance<br>
    Surpassed its other and its latest wont.
</p>
<p>
And as, by feeling greater delectation,<br>
    A man in doing good from day to day<br>
    Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,
</p>
<p>
So I became aware that my gyration<br>
    With heaven together had increased its arc,<br>
    That miracle beholding more adorned.
</p>
<p>
And such as is the change, in little lapse<br>
    Of time, in a pale woman, when her face<br>
    Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,
</p>
<p>
Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,<br>
    Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,<br>
    The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.
</p>
<p>
Within that Jovial torch did I behold<br>
    The sparkling of the love which was therein<br>
    Delineate our language to mine eyes.
</p>
<p>
And even as birds uprisen from the shore,<br>
    As in congratulation o’er their food,<br>
    Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,
</p>
<p>
So from within those lights the holy creatures<br>
    Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures<br>
    Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.
</p>
<p>
First singing they to their own music moved;<br>
    Then one becoming of these characters,<br>
    A little while they rested and were silent.
</p>
<p>
O divine Pegasea, thou who genius<br>
    Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,<br>
    And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,
</p>
<p>
Illume me with thyself, that I may bring<br>
    Their figures out as I have them conceived!<br>
    Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!
</p>
<p>
Themselves then they displayed in five times seven<br>
    Vowels and consonants; and I observed<br>
    The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.
</p>
<p>
‘Diligite justitiam,’ these were<br>
    First verb and noun of all that was depicted;<br>
    ‘Qui judicatis terram’ were the last.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter in the M of the fifth word<br>
    Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter<br>
    Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.
</p>
<p>
And other lights I saw descend where was<br>
    The summit of the M, and pause there singing<br>
    The good, I think, that draws them to itself.
</p>
<p>
Then, as in striking upon burning logs<br>
    Upward there fly innumerable sparks,<br>
    Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,
</p>
<p>
More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,<br>
    And to ascend, some more, and others less,<br>
    Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;
</p>
<p>
And, each one being quiet in its place,<br>
    The head and neck beheld I of an eagle<br>
    Delineated by that inlaid fire.
</p>
<p>
He who there paints has none to be his guide;<br>
    But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered<br>
    That virtue which is form unto the nest.
</p>
<p>
The other beatitude, that contented seemed<br>
    At first to bloom a lily on the M,<br>
    By a slight motion followed out the imprint.
</p>
<p>
O gentle star! what and how many gems<br>
    Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice<br>
    Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!
</p>
<p>
Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin<br>
    Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard<br>
    Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;
</p>
<p>
So that a second time it now be wroth<br>
    With buying and with selling in the temple<br>
    Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!
</p>
<p>
O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,<br>
    Implore for those who are upon the earth<br>
    All gone astray after the bad example!
</p>
<p>
Once ’twas the custom to make war with swords;<br>
    But now ’tis made by taking here and there<br>
    The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.
</p>
<p>
Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think<br>
    That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard<br>
    Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!
</p>
<p>
Well canst thou say: “So steadfast my desire<br>
    Is unto him who willed to live alone,<br>
    And for a dance was led to martyrdom,
</p>
<p>
That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XIX">
<p>
Appeared before me with its wings outspread<br>
    The beautiful image that in sweet fruition<br>
    Made jubilant the interwoven souls;
</p>
<p>
Appeared a little ruby each, wherein<br>
    Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled<br>
    That each into mine eyes refracted it.
</p>
<p>
And what it now behoves me to retrace<br>
    Nor voice has e’er reported, nor ink written,<br>
    Nor was by fantasy e’er comprehended;
</p>
<p>
For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,<br>
    And utter with its voice both ‘I’ and ‘My,’<br>
    When in conception it was ‘We’ and ‘Our.’
</p>
<p>
And it began: “Being just and merciful<br>
    Am I exalted here unto that glory<br>
    Which cannot be exceeded by desire;
</p>
<p>
And upon earth I left my memory<br>
    Such, that the evil-minded people there<br>
    Commend it, but continue not the story.”
</p>
<p>
So doth a single heat from many embers<br>
    Make itself felt, even as from many loves<br>
    Issued a single sound from out that image.
</p>
<p>
Whence I thereafter: “O perpetual flowers<br>
    Of the eternal joy, that only one<br>
    Make me perceive your odours manifold,
</p>
<p>
Exhaling, break within me the great fast<br>
    Which a long season has in hunger held me,<br>
    Not finding for it any food on earth.
</p>
<p>
Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror<br>
    Justice Divine another realm doth make,<br>
    Yours apprehends it not through any veil.
</p>
<p>
You know how I attentively address me<br>
    To listen; and you know what is the doubt<br>
    That is in me so very old a fast.”
</p>
<p>
Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,<br>
    Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,<br>
    Showing desire, and making himself fine,
</p>
<p>
Saw I become that standard, which of lauds<br>
    Was interwoven of the grace divine,<br>
    With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.
</p>
<p>
Then it began: “He who a compass turned<br>
    On the world’s outer verge, and who within it<br>
    Devised so much occult and manifest,
</p>
<p>
Could not the impress of his power so make<br>
    On all the universe, as that his Word<br>
    Should not remain in infinite excess.
</p>
<p>
And this makes certain that the first proud being,<br>
    Who was the paragon of every creature,<br>
    By not awaiting light fell immature.
</p>
<p>
And hence appears it, that each minor nature<br>
    Is scant receptacle unto that good<br>
    Which has no end, and by itself is measured.
</p>
<p>
In consequence our vision, which perforce<br>
    Must be some ray of that intelligence<br>
    With which all things whatever are replete,
</p>
<p>
Cannot in its own nature be so potent,<br>
    That it shall not its origin discern<br>
    Far beyond that which is apparent to it.
</p>
<p>
Therefore into the justice sempiternal<br>
    The power of vision that your world receives,<br>
    As eye into the ocean, penetrates;
</p>
<p>
Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,<br>
    Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet<br>
    ’Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.
</p>
<p>
There is no light but comes from the serene<br>
    That never is o’ercast, nay, it is darkness<br>
    Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.
</p>
<p>
Amply to thee is opened now the cavern<br>
    Which has concealed from thee the living justice<br>
    Of which thou mad’st such frequent questioning.
</p>
<p>
For saidst thou: ‘Born a man is on the shore<br>
    Of Indus, and is none who there can speak<br>
    Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;
</p>
<p>
And all his inclinations and his actions<br>
    Are good, so far as human reason sees,<br>
    Without a sin in life or in discourse:
</p>
<p>
He dieth unbaptised and without faith;<br>
    Where is this justice that condemneth him?<br>
    Where is his fault, if he do not believe?’
</p>
<p>
Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit<br>
    In judgment at a thousand miles away,<br>
    With the short vision of a single span?
</p>
<p>
Truly to him who with me subtilizes,<br>
    If so the Scripture were not over you,<br>
    For doubting there were marvellous occasion.
</p>
<p>
O animals terrene, O stolid minds,<br>
    The primal will, that in itself is good,<br>
    Ne’er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.
</p>
<p>
So much is just as is accordant with it;<br>
    No good created draws it to itself,<br>
    But it, by raying forth, occasions that.”
</p>
<p>
Even as above her nest goes circling round<br>
    The stork when she has fed her little ones,<br>
    And he who has been fed looks up at her,
</p>
<p>
So lifted I my brows, and even such<br>
    Became the blessed image, which its wings<br>
    Was moving, by so many counsels urged.
</p>
<p>
Circling around it sang, and said: “As are<br>
    My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,<br>
    Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.”
</p>
<p>
Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit<br>
    Grew quiet then, but still within the standard<br>
    That made the Romans reverend to the world.
</p>
<p>
It recommenced: “Unto this kingdom never<br>
    Ascended one who had not faith in Christ,<br>
    Before or since he to the tree was nailed.
</p>
<p>
But look thou, many crying are, ‘Christ, Christ!’<br>
    Who at the judgment shall be far less near<br>
    To him than some shall be who knew not Christ.
</p>
<p>
Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn,<br>
    When the two companies shall be divided,<br>
    The one for ever rich, the other poor.
</p>
<p>
What to your kings may not the Persians say,<br>
    When they that volume opened shall behold<br>
    In which are written down all their dispraises?
</p>
<p>
There shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert,<br>
    That which ere long shall set the pen in motion,<br>
    For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted.
</p>
<p>
There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine<br>
    He brings by falsifying of the coin,<br>
    Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die.
</p>
<p>
There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst,<br>
    Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad<br>
    That they within their boundaries cannot rest;
</p>
<p>
Be seen the luxury and effeminate life<br>
    Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian,<br>
    Who valour never knew and never wished;
</p>
<p>
Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem,<br>
    His goodness represented by an I,<br>
    While the reverse an M shall represent;
</p>
<p>
Be seen the avarice and poltroonery<br>
    Of him who guards the Island of the Fire,<br>
    Wherein Anchises finished his long life;
</p>
<p>
And to declare how pitiful he is<br>
    Shall be his record in contracted letters<br>
    Which shall make note of much in little space.
</p>
<p>
And shall appear to each one the foul deeds<br>
    Of uncle and of brother who a nation<br>
    So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns.
</p>
<p>
And he of Portugal and he of Norway<br>
    Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too,<br>
    Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice.
</p>
<p>
O happy Hungary, if she let herself<br>
    Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy,<br>
    If with the hills that gird her she be armed!
</p>
<p>
And each one may believe that now, as hansel<br>
    Thereof, do Nicosia and Famagosta<br>
    Lament and rage because of their own beast,
</p>
<p>
Who from the others’ flank departeth not.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XX">
<p>
When he who all the world illuminates<br>
    Out of our hemisphere so far descends<br>
    That on all sides the daylight is consumed,
</p>
<p>
The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,<br>
    Doth suddenly reveal itself again<br>
    By many lights, wherein is one resplendent.
</p>
<p>
And came into my mind this act of heaven,<br>
    When the ensign of the world and of its leaders<br>
    Had silent in the blessed beak become;
</p>
<p>
Because those living luminaries all,<br>
    By far more luminous, did songs begin<br>
    Lapsing and falling from my memory.
</p>
<p>
O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,<br>
    How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,<br>
    That had the breath alone of holy thoughts!
</p>
<p>
After the precious and pellucid crystals,<br>
    With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld,<br>
    Silence imposed on the angelic bells,
</p>
<p>
I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river<br>
    That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,<br>
    Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.
</p>
<p>
And as the sound upon the cithern’s neck<br>
    Taketh its form, and as upon the vent<br>
    Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,
</p>
<p>
Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,<br>
    That murmuring of the eagle mounted up<br>
    Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.
</p>
<p>
There it became a voice, and issued thence<br>
    From out its beak, in such a form of words<br>
    As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them.
</p>
<p>
“The part in me which sees and bears the sun<br>
    In mortal eagles,” it began to me,<br>
    “Now fixedly must needs be looked upon;
</p>
<p>
For of the fires of which I make my figure,<br>
    Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head<br>
    Of all their orders the supremest are.
</p>
<p>
He who is shining in the midst as pupil<br>
    Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,<br>
    Who bore the ark from city unto city;
</p>
<p>
Now knoweth he the merit of his song,<br>
    In so far as effect of his own counsel,<br>
    By the reward which is commensurate.
</p>
<p>
Of five, that make a circle for my brow,<br>
    He that approacheth nearest to my beak<br>
    Did the poor widow for her son console;
</p>
<p>
Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost<br>
    Not following Christ, by the experience<br>
    Of this sweet life and of its opposite.
</p>
<p>
He who comes next in the circumference<br>
    Of which I speak, upon its highest arc,<br>
    Did death postpone by penitence sincere;
</p>
<p>
Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment<br>
    Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer<br>
    Maketh below to-morrow of to-day.
</p>
<p>
The next who follows, with the laws and me,<br>
    Under the good intent that bore bad fruit<br>
    Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;
</p>
<p>
Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced<br>
    From his good action is not harmful to him,<br>
    Although the world thereby may be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
And he, whom in the downward arc thou seest,<br>
    Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores<br>
    That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive;
</p>
<p>
Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is<br>
    With a just king; and in the outward show<br>
    Of his effulgence he reveals it still.
</p>
<p>
Who would believe, down in the errant world,<br>
    That e’er the Trojan Ripheus in this round<br>
    Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?
</p>
<p>
Now knoweth he enough of what the world<br>
    Has not the power to see of grace divine,<br>
    Although his sight may not discern the bottom.”
</p>
<p>
Like as a lark that in the air expatiates,<br>
    First singing and then silent with content<br>
    Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,
</p>
<p>
Such seemed to me the image of the imprint<br>
    Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will<br>
    Doth everything become the thing it is.
</p>
<p>
And notwithstanding to my doubt I was<br>
    As glass is to the colour that invests it,<br>
    To wait the time in silence it endured not,
</p>
<p>
But forth from out my mouth, “What things are these?”<br>
    Extorted with the force of its own weight;<br>
    Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.
</p>
<p>
Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled<br>
    The blessed standard made to me reply,<br>
    To keep me not in wonderment suspended:
</p>
<p>
“I see that thou believest in these things<br>
    Because I say them, but thou seest not how;<br>
    So that, although believed in, they are hidden.
</p>
<p>
Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name<br>
    Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity<br>
    Cannot perceive, unless another show it.
</p>
<p>
‘Regnum coelorum’ suffereth violence<br>
    From fervent love, and from that living hope<br>
    That overcometh the Divine volition;
</p>
<p>
Not in the guise that man o’ercometh man,<br>
    But conquers it because it will be conquered,<br>
    And conquered conquers by benignity.
</p>
<p>
The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth<br>
    Cause thee astonishment, because with them<br>
    Thou seest the region of the angels painted.
</p>
<p>
They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,<br>
    Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith<br>
    Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.
</p>
<p>
For one from Hell, where no one e’er turns back<br>
    Unto good will, returned unto his bones,<br>
    And that of living hope was the reward,—
</p>
<p>
Of living hope, that placed its efficacy<br>
    In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,<br>
    So that ’twere possible to move his will.
</p>
<p>
The glorious soul concerning which I speak,<br>
    Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,<br>
    Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;
</p>
<p>
And, in believing, kindled to such fire<br>
    Of genuine love, that at the second death<br>
    Worthy it was to come unto this joy.
</p>
<p>
The other one, through grace, that from so deep<br>
    A fountain wells that never hath the eye<br>
    Of any creature reached its primal wave,
</p>
<p>
Set all his love below on righteousness;<br>
    Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose<br>
    His eye to our redemption yet to be,
</p>
<p>
Whence he believed therein, and suffered not<br>
    From that day forth the stench of paganism,<br>
    And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.
</p>
<p>
Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel<br>
    Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism<br>
    More than a thousand years before baptizing.
</p>
<p>
O thou predestination, how remote<br>
    Thy root is from the aspect of all those<br>
    Who the First Cause do not behold entire!
</p>
<p>
And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained<br>
    In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,<br>
    We do not know as yet all the elect;
</p>
<p>
And sweet to us is such a deprivation,<br>
    Because our good in this good is made perfect,<br>
    That whatsoe’er God wills, we also will.”
</p>
<p>
After this manner by that shape divine,<br>
    To make clear in me my short-sightedness,<br>
    Was given to me a pleasant medicine;
</p>
<p>
And as good singer a good lutanist<br>
    Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,<br>
    Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,
</p>
<p>
So, while it spake, do I remember me<br>
    That I beheld both of those blessed lights,<br>
    Even as the winking of the eyes concords,
</p>
<p>
Moving unto the words their little flames.

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXI">
<p>
Already on my Lady’s face mine eyes<br>
    Again were fastened, and with these my mind,<br>
    And from all other purpose was withdrawn;
</p>
<p>
And she smiled not; but “If I were to smile,”<br>
    She unto me began, “thou wouldst become<br>
    Like Semele, when she was turned to ashes.
</p>
<p>
Because my beauty, that along the stairs<br>
    Of the eternal palace more enkindles,<br>
    As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend,
</p>
<p>
If it were tempered not, is so resplendent<br>
    That all thy mortal power in its effulgence<br>
    Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes.
</p>
<p>
We are uplifted to the seventh splendour,<br>
    That underneath the burning Lion’s breast<br>
    Now radiates downward mingled with his power.
</p>
<p>
Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind,<br>
    And make of them a mirror for the figure<br>
    That in this mirror shall appear to thee.”
</p>
<p>
He who could know what was the pasturage<br>
    My sight had in that blessed countenance,<br>
    When I transferred me to another care,
</p>
<p>
Would recognize how grateful was to me<br>
    Obedience unto my celestial escort,<br>
    By counterpoising one side with the other.
</p>
<p>
Within the crystal which, around the world<br>
    Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,<br>
    Under whom every wickedness lay dead,
</p>
<p>
Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,<br>
    A stairway I beheld to such a height<br>
    Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.
</p>
<p>
Likewise beheld I down the steps descending<br>
    So many splendours, that I thought each light<br>
    That in the heaven appears was there diffused.
</p>
<p>
And as accordant with their natural custom<br>
    The rooks together at the break of day<br>
    Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;
</p>
<p>
Then some of them fly off without return,<br>
    Others come back to where they started from,<br>
    And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;
</p>
<p>
Such fashion it appeared to me was there<br>
    Within the sparkling that together came,<br>
    As soon as on a certain step it struck,
</p>
<p>
And that which nearest unto us remained<br>
    Became so clear, that in my thought I said,<br>
    “Well I perceive the love thou showest me;
</p>
<p>
But she, from whom I wait the how and when<br>
    Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I<br>
    Against desire do well if I ask not.”
</p>
<p>
She thereupon, who saw my silentness<br>
    In the sight of Him who seeth everything,<br>
    Said unto me, “Let loose thy warm desire.”
</p>
<p>
And I began: “No merit of my own<br>
    Renders me worthy of response from thee;<br>
    But for her sake who granteth me the asking,
</p>
<p>
Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed<br>
    In thy beatitude, make known to me<br>
    The cause which draweth thee so near my side;
</p>
<p>
And tell me why is silent in this wheel<br>
    The dulcet symphony of Paradise,<br>
    That through the rest below sounds so devoutly.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,”<br>
    It answer made to me; “they sing not here,<br>
    For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.
</p>
<p>
Thus far adown the holy stairway’s steps<br>
    Have I descended but to give thee welcome<br>
    With words, and with the light that mantles me;
</p>
<p>
Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,<br>
    For love as much and more up there is burning,<br>
    As doth the flaming manifest to thee.
</p>
<p>
But the high charity, that makes us servants<br>
    Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,<br>
    Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.”
</p>
<p>
“I see full well,” said I, “O sacred lamp!<br>
    How love unfettered in this court sufficeth<br>
    To follow the eternal Providence;
</p>
<p>
But this is what seems hard for me to see,<br>
    Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone<br>
    Unto this office from among thy consorts.”
</p>
<p>
No sooner had I come to the last word,<br>
    Than of its middle made the light a centre,<br>
    Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.
</p>
<p>
When answer made the love that was therein:<br>
    “On me directed is a light divine,<br>
    Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,
</p>
<p>
Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined<br>
    Lifts me above myself so far, I see<br>
    The supreme essence from which this is drawn.
</p>
<p>
Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,<br>
    For to my sight, as far as it is clear,<br>
    The clearness of the flame I equal make.
</p>
<p>
But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,<br>
    That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,<br>
    Could this demand of thine not satisfy;
</p>
<p>
Because so deeply sinks in the abyss<br>
    Of the eternal statute what thou askest,<br>
    From all created sight it is cut off.
</p>
<p>
And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,<br>
    This carry back, that it may not presume<br>
    Longer tow’rd such a goal to move its feet.
</p>
<p>
The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;<br>
    From this observe how can it do below<br>
    That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?”
</p>
<p>
Such limit did its words prescribe to me,<br>
    The question I relinquished, and restricted<br>
    Myself to ask it humbly who it was.
</p>
<p>
“Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,<br>
    And not far distant from thy native place,<br>
    So high, the thunders far below them sound,
</p>
<p>
And form a ridge that Catria is called,<br>
    ’Neath which is consecrate a hermitage<br>
    Wont to be dedicate to worship only.”
</p>
<p>
Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<br>
    And then, continuing, it said: “Therein<br>
    Unto God’s service I became so steadfast,
</p>
<p>
That feeding only on the juice of olives<br>
    Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,<br>
    Contented in my thoughts contemplative.
</p>
<p>
That cloister used to render to these heavens<br>
    Abundantly, and now is empty grown,<br>
    So that perforce it soon must be revealed.
</p>
<p>
I in that place was Peter Damiano;<br>
    And Peter the Sinner was I in the house<br>
    Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.
</p>
<p>
Little of mortal life remained to me,<br>
    When I was called and dragged forth to the hat<br>
    Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.
</p>
<p>
Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came<br>
    Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,<br>
    Taking the food of any hostelry.
</p>
<p>
Now some one to support them on each side<br>
    The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,<br>
    So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.
</p>
<p>
They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,<br>
    So that two beasts go underneath one skin;<br>
    O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!”
</p>
<p>
At this voice saw I many little flames<br>
    From step to step descending and revolving,<br>
    And every revolution made them fairer.
</p>
<p>
Round about this one came they and stood still,<br>
    And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,<br>
    It here could find no parallel, nor I
</p>
<p>
Distinguished it, the thunder so o’ercame me.
</p>

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXII">
<p>
Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide<br>
    Turned like a little child who always runs<br>
    For refuge there where he confideth most;
</p>
<p>
And she, even as a mother who straightway<br>
    Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy<br>
    With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,
</p>
<p>
Said to me: “Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,<br>
    And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all<br>
    And what is done here cometh from good zeal?
</p>
<p>
After what wise the singing would have changed thee<br>
    And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,<br>
    Since that the cry has startled thee so much,
</p>
<p>
In which if thou hadst understood its prayers<br>
    Already would be known to thee the vengeance<br>
    Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.
</p>
<p>
The sword above here smiteth not in haste<br>
    Nor tardily, howe’er it seem to him<br>
    Who fearing or desiring waits for it.
</p>
<p>
But turn thee round towards the others now,<br>
    For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,<br>
    If thou thy sight directest as I say.”
</p>
<p>
As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,<br>
    And saw a hundred spherules that together<br>
    With mutual rays each other more embellished.
</p>
<p>
I stood as one who in himself represses<br>
    The point of his desire, and ventures not<br>
    To question, he so feareth the too much.
</p>
<p>
And now the largest and most luculent<br>
    Among those pearls came forward, that it might<br>
    Make my desire concerning it content.
</p>
<p>
Within it then I heard: “If thou couldst see<br>
    Even as myself the charity that burns<br>
    Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;
</p>
<p>
But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late<br>
    To the high end, I will make answer even<br>
    Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.
</p>
<p>
That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands<br>
    Was frequented of old upon its summit<br>
    By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;
</p>
<p>
And I am he who first up thither bore<br>
    The name of Him who brought upon the earth<br>
    The truth that so much sublimateth us.
</p>
<p>
And such abundant grace upon me shone<br>
    That all the neighbouring towns I drew away<br>
    From the impious worship that seduced the world.
</p>
<p>
These other fires, each one of them, were men<br>
    Contemplative, enkindled by that heat<br>
    Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.
</p>
<p>
Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<br>
    Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters<br>
    Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart.”
</p>
<p>
And I to him: “The affection which thou showest<br>
    Speaking with me, and the good countenance<br>
    Which I behold and note in all your ardours,
</p>
<p>
In me have so my confidence dilated<br>
    As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes<br>
    As far unfolded as it hath the power.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,<br>
    If I may so much grace receive, that I<br>
    May thee behold with countenance unveiled.”
</p>
<p>
He thereupon: “Brother, thy high desire<br>
    In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,<br>
    Where are fulfilled all others and my own.
</p>
<p>
There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,<br>
    Every desire; within that one alone<br>
    Is every part where it has always been;
</p>
<p>
For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,<br>
    And unto it our stairway reaches up,<br>
    Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.
</p>
<p>
Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<br>
    Extending its supernal part, what time<br>
    So thronged with angels it appeared to him.
</p>
<p>
But to ascend it now no one uplifts<br>
    His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule<br>
    Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.
</p>
<p>
The walls that used of old to be an Abbey<br>
    Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls<br>
    Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.
</p>
<p>
But heavy usury is not taken up<br>
    So much against God’s pleasure as that fruit<br>
    Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;
</p>
<p>
For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping<br>
    Is for the folk that ask it in God’s name,<br>
    Not for one’s kindred or for something worse.
</p>
<p>
The flesh of mortals is so very soft,<br>
    That good beginnings down below suffice not<br>
    From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.
</p>
<p>
Peter began with neither gold nor silver,<br>
    And I with orison and abstinence,<br>
    And Francis with humility his convent.
</p>
<p>
And if thou lookest at each one’s beginning,<br>
    And then regardest whither he has run,<br>
    Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.
</p>
<p>
In verity the Jordan backward turned,<br>
    And the sea’s fleeing, when God willed were more<br>
    A wonder to behold, than succour here.”
</p>
<p>
Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew<br>
    To his own band, and the band closed together;<br>
    Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.
</p>
<p>
The gentle Lady urged me on behind them<br>
    Up o’er that stairway by a single sign,<br>
    So did her virtue overcome my nature;
</p>
<p>
Nor here below, where one goes up and down<br>
    By natural law, was motion e’er so swift<br>
    That it could be compared unto my wing.
</p>
<p>
Reader, as I may unto that devout<br>
    Triumph return, on whose account I often<br>
    For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,—
</p>
<p>
Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire<br>
    And drawn it out again, before I saw<br>
    The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.
</p>
<p>
O glorious stars, O light impregnated<br>
    With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge<br>
    All of my genius, whatsoe’er it be,
</p>
<p>
With you was born, and hid himself with you,<br>
    He who is father of all mortal life,<br>
    When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;
</p>
<p>
And then when grace was freely given to me<br>
    To enter the high wheel which turns you round,<br>
    Your region was allotted unto me.
</p>
<p>
To you devoutly at this hour my soul<br>
    Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire<br>
    For the stern pass that draws it to itself.
</p>
<p>
“Thou art so near unto the last salvation,”<br>
    Thus Beatrice began, “thou oughtest now<br>
    To have thine eves unclouded and acute;
</p>
<p>
And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,<br>
    Look down once more, and see how vast a world<br>
    Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;
</p>
<p>
So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,<br>
    Present itself to the triumphant throng<br>
    That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether.”
</p>
<p>
I with my sight returned through one and all<br>
    The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe<br>
    Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;
</p>
<p>
And that opinion I approve as best<br>
    Which doth account it least; and he who thinks<br>
    Of something else may truly be called just.
</p>
<p>
I saw the daughter of Latona shining<br>
    Without that shadow, which to me was cause<br>
    That once I had believed her rare and dense.
</p>
<p>
The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,<br>
    Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves<br>
    Around and near him Maia and Dione.
</p>
<p>
Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove<br>
    ’Twixt son and father, and to me was clear<br>
    The change that of their whereabout they make;
</p>
<p>
And all the seven made manifest to me<br>
    How great they are, and eke how swift they are,<br>
    And how they are in distant habitations.
</p>
<p>
The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,<br>
    To me revolving with the eternal Twins,<br>
    Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!
</p>
<p>
Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXIII">
<p>
Even as a bird, ’mid the beloved leaves,<br>
    Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood<br>
    Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,
</p>
<p>
Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks<br>
    And find the food wherewith to nourish them,<br>
    In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,
</p>
<p>
Anticipates the time on open spray<br>
    And with an ardent longing waits the sun,<br>
    Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:
</p>
<p>
Even thus my Lady standing was, erect<br>
    And vigilant, turned round towards the zone<br>
    Underneath which the sun displays less haste;
</p>
<p>
So that beholding her distraught and wistful,<br>
    Such I became as he is who desiring<br>
    For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.
</p>
<p>
But brief the space from one When to the other;<br>
    Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing<br>
    The welkin grow resplendent more and more.
</p>
<p>
And Beatrice exclaimed: “Behold the hosts<br>
    Of Christ’s triumphal march, and all the fruit<br>
    Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!”
</p>
<p>
It seemed to me her face was all aflame;<br>
    And eyes she had so full of ecstasy<br>
    That I must needs pass on without describing.
</p>
<p>
As when in nights serene of the full moon<br>
    Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal<br>
    Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,
</p>
<p>
Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,<br>
    A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,<br>
    E’en as our own doth the supernal sights,
</p>
<p>
And through the living light transparent shone<br>
    The lucent substance so intensely clear<br>
    Into my sight, that I sustained it not.
</p>
<p>
O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!<br>
    To me she said: “What overmasters thee<br>
    A virtue is from which naught shields itself.
</p>
<p>
There are the wisdom and the omnipotence<br>
    That oped the thoroughfares ’twixt heaven and earth,<br>
    For which there erst had been so long a yearning.”
</p>
<p>
As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,<br>
    Dilating so it finds not room therein,<br>
    And down, against its nature, falls to earth,
</p>
<p>
So did my mind, among those aliments<br>
    Becoming larger, issue from itself,<br>
    And that which it became cannot remember.
</p>
<p>
“Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<br>
    Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough<br>
    Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.”
</p>
<p>
I was as one who still retains the feeling<br>
    Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours<br>
    In vain to bring it back into his mind,
</p>
<p>
When I this invitation heard, deserving<br>
    Of so much gratitude, it never fades<br>
    Out of the book that chronicles the past.
</p>
<p>
If at this moment sounded all the tongues<br>
    That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<br>
    Most lubrical with their delicious milk,
</p>
<p>
To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth<br>
    It would not reach, singing the holy smile<br>
    And how the holy aspect it illumed.
</p>
<p>
And therefore, representing Paradise,<br>
    The sacred poem must perforce leap over,<br>
    Even as a man who finds his way cut off;
</p>
<p>
But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,<br>
    And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,<br>
    Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.
</p>
<p>
It is no passage for a little boat<br>
    This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,<br>
    Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.
</p>
<p>
“Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<br>
    That to the garden fair thou turnest not,<br>
    Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?
</p>
<p>
There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<br>
    Became incarnate; there the lilies are<br>
    By whose perfume the good way was discovered.”
</p>
<p>
Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels<br>
    Was wholly ready, once again betook me<br>
    Unto the battle of the feeble brows.
</p>
<p>
As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams<br>
    Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers<br>
    Mine eyes with shadow covered o’er have seen,
</p>
<p>
So troops of splendours manifold I saw<br>
    Illumined from above with burning rays,<br>
    Beholding not the source of the effulgence.
</p>
<p>
O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<br>
    Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope<br>
    There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.
</p>
<p>
The name of that fair flower I e’er invoke<br>
    Morning and evening utterly enthralled<br>
    My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.
</p>
<p>
And when in both mine eyes depicted were<br>
    The glory and greatness of the living star<br>
    Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,
</p>
<p>
Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<br>
    Formed in a circle like a coronal,<br>
    And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.
</p>
<p>
Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth<br>
    On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,<br>
    Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,
</p>
<p>
Compared unto the sounding of that lyre<br>
    Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<br>
    Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.
</p>
<p>
“I am Angelic Love, that circle round<br>
    The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb<br>
    That was the hostelry of our Desire;
</p>
<p>
And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while<br>
    Thou followest thy Son, and mak’st diviner<br>
    The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.”
</p>
<p>
Thus did the circulated melody<br>
    Seal itself up; and all the other lights<br>
    Were making to resound the name of Mary.
</p>
<p>
The regal mantle of the volumes all<br>
    Of that world, which most fervid is and living<br>
    With breath of God and with his works and ways,
</p>
<p>
Extended over us its inner border,<br>
    So very distant, that the semblance of it<br>
    There where I was not yet appeared to me.
</p>
<p>
Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power<br>
    Of following the incoronated flame,<br>
    Which mounted upward near to its own seed.
</p>
<p>
And as a little child, that towards its mother<br>
    Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,<br>
    Through impulse kindled into outward flame,
</p>
<p>
Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached<br>
    So with its summit, that the deep affection<br>
    They had for Mary was revealed to me.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter they remained there in my sight,<br>
    ‘Regina coeli’ singing with such sweetness,<br>
    That ne’er from me has the delight departed.
</p>
<p>
O, what exuberance is garnered up<br>
    Within those richest coffers, which had been<br>
    Good husbandmen for sowing here below!
</p>
<p>
There they enjoy and live upon the treasure<br>
    Which was acquired while weeping in the exile<br>
    Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.
</p>
<p>
There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son<br>
    Of God and Mary, in his victory,<br>
    Both with the ancient council and the new,
</p>
<p>
He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXIV">
<p>
“O company elect to the great supper<br>
    Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you<br>
    So that for ever full is your desire,
</p>
<p>
If by the grace of God this man foretaste<br>
    Something of that which falleth from your table,<br>
    Or ever death prescribe to him the time,
</p>
<p>
Direct your mind to his immense desire,<br>
    And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are<br>
    For ever at the fount whence comes his thought.”
</p>
<p>
Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified<br>
    Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,<br>
    Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.
</p>
<p>
And as the wheels in works of horologes<br>
    Revolve so that the first to the beholder<br>
    Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,
</p>
<p>
So in like manner did those carols, dancing<br>
    In different measure, of their affluence<br>
    Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.
</p>
<p>
From that one which I noted of most beauty<br>
    Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy<br>
    That none it left there of a greater brightness;
</p>
<p>
And around Beatrice three several times<br>
    It whirled itself with so divine a song,<br>
    My fantasy repeats it not to me;
</p>
<p>
Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,<br>
    Since our imagination for such folds,<br>
    Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.
</p>
<p>
“O holy sister mine, who us implorest<br>
    With such devotion, by thine ardent love<br>
    Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!”
</p>
<p>
Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire<br>
    Unto my Lady did direct its breath,<br>
    Which spake in fashion as I here have said.
</p>
<p>
And she: “O light eterne of the great man<br>
    To whom our Lord delivered up the keys<br>
    He carried down of this miraculous joy,
</p>
<p>
This one examine on points light and grave,<br>
    As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith<br>
    By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.
</p>
<p>
If he love well, and hope well, and believe,<br>
    From thee ’tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight<br>
    There where depicted everything is seen.
</p>
<p>
But since this kingdom has made citizens<br>
    By means of the true Faith, to glorify it<br>
    ’Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof.”
</p>
<p>
As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not<br>
    Until the master doth propose the question,<br>
    To argue it, and not to terminate it,
</p>
<p>
So did I arm myself with every reason,<br>
    While she was speaking, that I might be ready<br>
    For such a questioner and such profession.
</p>
<p>
“Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;<br>
    What is the Faith?” Whereat I raised my brow<br>
    Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.
</p>
<p>
Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she<br>
    Prompt signals made to me that I should pour<br>
    The water forth from my internal fountain.
</p>
<p>
“May grace, that suffers me to make confession,”<br>
    Began I, “to the great centurion,<br>
    Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!”
</p>
<p>
And I continued: “As the truthful pen,<br>
    Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<br>
    Who put with thee Rome into the good way,
</p>
<p>
Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,<br>
    And evidence of those that are not seen;<br>
    And this appears to me its quiddity.”
</p>
<p>
Then heard I: “Very rightly thou perceivest,<br>
    If well thou understandest why he placed it<br>
    With substances and then with evidences.”
</p>
<p>
And I thereafterward: “The things profound,<br>
    That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,<br>
    Unto all eyes below are so concealed,
</p>
<p>
That they exist there only in belief,<br>
    Upon the which is founded the high hope,<br>
    And hence it takes the nature of a substance.
</p>
<p>
And it behoveth us from this belief<br>
    To reason without having other sight,<br>
    And hence it has the nature of evidence.”
</p>
<p>
Then heard I: “If whatever is acquired<br>
    Below by doctrine were thus understood,<br>
    No sophist’s subtlety would there find place.”
</p>
<p>
Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;<br>
    Then added: “Very well has been gone over<br>
    Already of this coin the alloy and weight;
</p>
<p>
But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?”<br>
    And I: “Yes, both so shining and so round<br>
    That in its stamp there is no peradventure.”
</p>
<p>
Thereafter issued from the light profound<br>
    That there resplendent was: “This precious jewel,<br>
    Upon the which is every virtue founded,
</p>
<p>
Whence hadst thou it?” And I: “The large outpouring<br>
    Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused<br>
    Upon the ancient parchments and the new,
</p>
<p>
A syllogism is, which proved it to me<br>
    With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,<br>
    All demonstration seems to me obtuse.”
</p>
<p>
And then I heard: “The ancient and the new<br>
    Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,<br>
    Why dost thou take them for the word divine?”
</p>
<p>
And I: “The proofs, which show the truth to me,<br>
    Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature<br>
    Ne’er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.”
</p>
<p>
’Twas answered me: “Say, who assureth thee<br>
    That those works ever were? the thing itself<br>
    That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.”
</p>
<p>
“Were the world to Christianity converted,”<br>
    I said, “withouten miracles, this one<br>
    Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;
</p>
<p>
Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter<br>
    Into the field to sow there the good plant,<br>
    Which was a vine and has become a thorn!”
</p>
<p>
This being finished, the high, holy Court<br>
    Resounded through the spheres, “One God we praise!”<br>
    In melody that there above is chanted.
</p>
<p>
And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<br>
    Examining, had thus conducted me,<br>
    Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,
</p>
<p>
Again began: “The Grace that dallying<br>
    Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,<br>
    Up to this point, as it should opened be,
</p>
<p>
So that I do approve what forth emerged;<br>
    But now thou must express what thou believest,<br>
    And whence to thy belief it was presented.”
</p>
<p>
“O holy father, spirit who beholdest<br>
    What thou believedst so that thou o’ercamest,<br>
    Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,”
</p>
<p>
Began I, “thou dost wish me in this place<br>
    The form to manifest of my prompt belief,<br>
    And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.
</p>
<p>
And I respond: In one God I believe,<br>
    Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens<br>
    With love and with desire, himself unmoved;
</p>
<p>
And of such faith not only have I proofs<br>
    Physical and metaphysical, but gives them<br>
    Likewise the truth that from this place rains down
</p>
<p>
Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,<br>
    Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote<br>
    After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;
</p>
<p>
In Persons three eterne believe, and these<br>
    One essence I believe, so one and trine<br>
    They bear conjunction both with ‘sunt’ and ‘est.’
</p>
<p>
With the profound condition and divine<br>
    Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind<br>
    Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.
</p>
<p>
This the beginning is, this is the spark<br>
    Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,<br>
    And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.”
</p>
<p>
Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him<br>
    His servant straight embraces, gratulating<br>
    For the good news as soon as he is silent;
</p>
<p>
So, giving me its benediction, singing,<br>
    Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<br>
    The apostolic light, at whose command
</p>
<p>
I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXV">
<p>
If e’er it happen that the Poem Sacred,<br>
    To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,<br>
    So that it many a year hath made me lean,
</p>
<p>
O’ercome the cruelty that bars me out<br>
    From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,<br>
    An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,
</p>
<p>
With other voice forthwith, with other fleece<br>
    Poet will I return, and at my font<br>
    Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;
</p>
<p>
Because into the Faith that maketh known<br>
    All souls to God there entered I, and then<br>
    Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.
</p>
<p>
Thereafterward towards us moved a light<br>
    Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<br>
    Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,
</p>
<p>
And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,<br>
    Said unto me: “Look, look! behold the Baron<br>
    For whom below Galicia is frequented.”
</p>
<p>
In the same way as, when a dove alights<br>
    Near his companion, both of them pour forth,<br>
    Circling about and murmuring, their affection,
</p>
<p>
So one beheld I by the other grand<br>
    Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,<br>
    Lauding the food that there above is eaten.
</p>
<p>
But when their gratulations were complete,<br>
    Silently ‘coram me’ each one stood still,<br>
    So incandescent it o’ercame my sight.
</p>
<p>
Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:<br>
    “Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<br>
    Of our Basilica have been described,
</p>
<p>
Make Hope resound within this altitude;<br>
    Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it<br>
    As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.”—
</p>
<p>
“Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<br>
    For what comes hither from the mortal world<br>
    Must needs be ripened in our radiance.”
</p>
<p>
This comfort came to me from the second fire;<br>
    Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<br>
    Which bent them down before with too great weight.
</p>
<p>
“Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou<br>
    Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,<br>
    In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,
</p>
<p>
So that, the truth beholden of this court,<br>
    Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,<br>
    Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,
</p>
<p>
Say what it is, and how is flowering with it<br>
    Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.”<br>
    Thus did the second light again continue.
</p>
<p>
And the Compassionate, who piloted<br>
    The plumage of my wings in such high flight,<br>
    Did in reply anticipate me thus:
</p>
<p>
“No child whatever the Church Militant<br>
    Of greater hope possesses, as is written<br>
    In that Sun which irradiates all our band;
</p>
<p>
Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt<br>
    To come into Jerusalem to see,<br>
    Or ever yet his warfare be completed.
</p>
<p>
The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<br>
    Have been demanded, but that he report<br>
    How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,
</p>
<p>
To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,<br>
    Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<br>
    And may the grace of God in this assist him!”
</p>
<p>
As a disciple, who his teacher follows,<br>
    Ready and willing, where he is expert,<br>
    That his proficiency may be displayed,
</p>
<p>
“Hope,” said I, “is the certain expectation<br>
    Of future glory, which is the effect<br>
    Of grace divine and merit precedent.
</p>
<p>
From many stars this light comes unto me;<br>
    But he instilled it first into my heart<br>
    Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.
</p>
<p>
‘Sperent in te,’ in the high Theody<br>
    He sayeth, ‘those who know thy name;’ and who<br>
    Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?
</p>
<p>
Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling<br>
    In the Epistle, so that I am full,<br>
    And upon others rain again your rain.”
</p>
<p>
While I was speaking, in the living bosom<br>
    Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,<br>
    Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;
</p>
<p>
Then breathed: “The love wherewith I am inflamed<br>
    Towards the virtue still which followed me<br>
    Unto the palm and issue of the field,
</p>
<p>
Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight<br>
    In her; and grateful to me is thy telling<br>
    Whatever things Hope promises to thee.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “The ancient Scriptures and the new<br>
    The mark establish, and this shows it me,<br>
    Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.
</p>
<p>
Isaiah saith, that each one garmented<br>
    In his own land shall be with twofold garments,<br>
    And his own land is this delightful life.
</p>
<p>
Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,<br>
    There where he treateth of the robes of white,<br>
    This revelation manifests to us.”
</p>
<p>
And first, and near the ending of these words,<br>
    “Sperent in te” from over us was heard,<br>
    To which responsive answered all the carols.
</p>
<p>
Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<br>
    So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<br>
    Winter would have a month of one sole day.
</p>
<p>
And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance<br>
    A winsome maiden, only to do honour<br>
    To the new bride, and not from any failing,
</p>
<p>
Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour<br>
    Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<br>
    As was beseeming to their ardent love.
</p>
<p>
Into the song and music there it entered;<br>
    And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,<br>
    Even as a bride silent and motionless.
</p>
<p>
“This is the one who lay upon the breast<br>
    Of him our Pelican; and this is he<br>
    To the great office from the cross elected.”
</p>
<p>
My Lady thus; but therefore none the more<br>
    Did move her sight from its attentive gaze<br>
    Before or afterward these words of hers.
</p>
<p>
Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours<br>
    To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,<br>
    And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,
</p>
<p>
So I became before that latest fire,<br>
    While it was said, “Why dost thou daze thyself<br>
    To see a thing which here hath no existence?
</p>
<p>
Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be<br>
    With all the others there, until our number<br>
    With the eternal proposition tallies.
</p>
<p>
With the two garments in the blessed cloister<br>
    Are the two lights alone that have ascended:<br>
    And this shalt thou take back into your world.”
</p>
<p>
And at this utterance the flaming circle<br>
    Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling<br>
    Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,
</p>
<p>
As to escape from danger or fatigue<br>
    The oars that erst were in the water beaten<br>
    Are all suspended at a whistle’s sound.
</p>
<p>
Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,<br>
    When I turned round to look on Beatrice,<br>
    That her I could not see, although I was
</p>
<p>
Close at her side and in the Happy World!
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXVI">
<p>
While I was doubting for my vision quenched,<br>
    Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it<br>
    Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,
</p>
<p>
Saying: “While thou recoverest the sense<br>
    Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,<br>
    ’Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.
</p>
<p>
Begin then, and declare to what thy soul<br>
    Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,<br>
    Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;
</p>
<p>
Because the Lady, who through this divine<br>
    Region conducteth thee, has in her look<br>
    The power the hand of Ananias had.”
</p>
<p>
I said: “As pleaseth her, or soon or late<br>
    Let the cure come to eyes that portals were<br>
    When she with fire I ever burn with entered.
</p>
<p>
The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,<br>
    The Alpha and Omega is of all<br>
    The writing that love reads me low or loud.”
</p>
<p>
The selfsame voice, that taken had from me<br>
    The terror of the sudden dazzlement,<br>
    To speak still farther put it in my thought;
</p>
<p>
And said: “In verity with finer sieve<br>
    Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth<br>
    To say who aimed thy bow at such a target.”
</p>
<p>
And I: “By philosophic arguments,<br>
    And by authority that hence descends,<br>
    Such love must needs imprint itself in me;
</p>
<p>
For Good, so far as good, when comprehended<br>
    Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater<br>
    As more of goodness in itself it holds;
</p>
<p>
Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage<br>
    That every good which out of it is found<br>
    Is nothing but a ray of its own light)
</p>
<p>
More than elsewhither must the mind be moved<br>
    Of every one, in loving, who discerns<br>
    The truth in which this evidence is founded.
</p>
<p>
Such truth he to my intellect reveals<br>
    Who demonstrates to me the primal love<br>
    Of all the sempiternal substances.
</p>
<p>
The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,<br>
    Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,<br>
    ‘I will make all my goodness pass before thee.’
</p>
<p>
Thou too revealest it to me, beginning<br>
    The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret<br>
    Of heaven to earth above all other edict.”
</p>
<p>
And I heard say: “By human intellect<br>
    And by authority concordant with it,<br>
    Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.
</p>
<p>
But say again if other cords thou feelest,<br>
    Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim<br>
    With how many teeth this love is biting thee.”
</p>
<p>
The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ<br>
    Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived<br>
    Whither he fain would my profession lead.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I recommenced: “All of those bites<br>
    Which have the power to turn the heart to God<br>
    Unto my charity have been concurrent.
</p>
<p>
The being of the world, and my own being,<br>
    The death which He endured that I may live,<br>
    And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,
</p>
<p>
With the forementioned vivid consciousness<br>
    Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,<br>
    And of the right have placed me on the shore.
</p>
<p>
The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden<br>
    Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love<br>
    As much as he has granted them of good.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet<br>
    Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady<br>
    Said with the others, “Holy, holy, holy!”
</p>
<p>
And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep<br>
    By reason of the visual spirit that runs<br>
    Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,
</p>
<p>
And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,<br>
    So all unconscious is his sudden waking,<br>
    Until the judgment cometh to his aid,
</p>
<p>
So from before mine eyes did Beatrice<br>
    Chase every mote with radiance of her own,<br>
    That cast its light a thousand miles and more.
</p>
<p>
Whence better after than before I saw,<br>
    And in a kind of wonderment I asked<br>
    About a fourth light that I saw with us.
</p>
<p>
And said my Lady: “There within those rays<br>
    Gazes upon its Maker the first soul<br>
    That ever the first virtue did create.”
</p>
<p>
Even as the bough that downward bends its top<br>
    At transit of the wind, and then is lifted<br>
    By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,

<p>
Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,<br>
    Being amazed, and then I was made bold<br>
    By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.
</p>
<p>
And I began: “O apple, that mature<br>
    Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,<br>
    To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,
</p>
<p>
Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee<br>
    That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;<br>
    And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.”
</p>
<p>
Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles<br>
    So that his impulse needs must be apparent,<br>
    By reason of the wrappage following it;
</p>
<p>
And in like manner the primeval soul<br>
    Made clear to me athwart its covering<br>
    How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Then breathed: “Without thy uttering it to me,<br>
    Thine inclination better I discern<br>
    Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;
</p>
<p>
For I behold it in the truthful mirror,<br>
    That of Himself all things parhelion makes,<br>
    And none makes Him parhelion of itself.
</p>
<p>
Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me<br>
    Within the lofty garden, where this Lady<br>
    Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.
</p>
<p>
And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,<br>
    And of the great disdain the proper cause,<br>
    And the language that I used and that I made.
</p>
<p>
Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree<br>
    Not in itself was cause of so great exile,<br>
    But solely the o’erstepping of the bounds.
</p>
<p>
There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,<br>
    Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits<br>
    Made by the sun, this Council I desired;
</p>
<p>
And him I saw return to all the lights<br>
    Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,<br>
    Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.
</p>
<p>
The language that I spake was quite extinct<br>
    Before that in the work interminable<br>
    The people under Nimrod were employed;
</p>
<p>
For nevermore result of reasoning<br>
    (Because of human pleasure that doth change,<br>
    Obedient to the heavens) was durable.
</p>
<p>
A natural action is it that man speaks;<br>
    But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave<br>
    To your own art, as seemeth best to you.
</p>
<p>
Ere I descended to the infernal anguish,<br>
    ‘El’ was on earth the name of the Chief Good,<br>
    From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round
</p>
<p>
‘Eli’ he then was called, and that is proper,<br>
    Because the use of men is like a leaf<br>
    On bough, which goeth and another cometh.
</p>
<p>
Upon the mount that highest o’er the wave<br>
    Rises was I, in life or pure or sinful,<br>
    From the first hour to that which is the second,
</p>
<p>
As the sun changes quadrant, to the sixth.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXVII">
<p>
“Glory be to the Father, to the Son,<br>
    And Holy Ghost!” all Paradise began,<br>
    So that the melody inebriate made me.
</p>
<p>
What I beheld seemed unto me a smile<br>
    Of the universe; for my inebriation<br>
    Found entrance through the hearing and the sight.
</p>
<p>
O joy! O gladness inexpressible!<br>
    O perfect life of love and peacefulness!<br>
    O riches without hankering secure!
</p>
<p>
Before mine eyes were standing the four torches<br>
    Enkindled, and the one that first had come<br>
    Began to make itself more luminous;
</p>
<p>
And even such in semblance it became<br>
    As Jupiter would become, if he and Mars<br>
    Were birds, and they should interchange their feathers.
</p>
<p>
That Providence, which here distributeth<br>
    Season and service, in the blessed choir<br>
    Had silence upon every side imposed.
</p>
<p>
When I heard say: “If I my colour change,<br>
    Marvel not at it; for while I am speaking<br>
    Thou shalt behold all these their colour change.
</p>
<p>
He who usurps upon the earth my place,<br>
    My place, my place, which vacant has become<br>
    Before the presence of the Son of God,
</p>
<p>
Has of my cemetery made a sewer<br>
    Of blood and stench, whereby the Perverse One,<br>
    Who fell from here, below there is appeased!”
</p>
<p>
With the same colour which, through sun adverse,<br>
    Painteth the clouds at evening or at morn,<br>
    Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused.
</p>
<p>
And as a modest woman, who abides<br>
    Sure of herself, and at another’s failing,<br>
    From listening only, timorous becomes,
</p>
<p>
Even thus did Beatrice change countenance;<br>
    And I believe in heaven was such eclipse,<br>
    When suffered the supreme Omnipotence;
</p>
<p>
Thereafterward proceeded forth his words<br>
    With voice so much transmuted from itself,<br>
    The very countenance was not more changed.
</p>
<p>
“The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been<br>
    On blood of mine, of Linus and of Cletus,<br>
    To be made use of in acquest of gold;
</p>
<p>
But in acquest of this delightful life<br>
    Sixtus and Pius, Urban and Calixtus,<br>
    After much lamentation, shed their blood.
</p>
<p>
Our purpose was not, that on the right hand<br>
    Of our successors should in part be seated<br>
    The Christian folk, in part upon the other;
</p>
<p>
Nor that the keys which were to me confided<br>
    Should e’er become the escutcheon on a banner,<br>
    That should wage war on those who are baptized;
</p>
<p>
Nor I be made the figure of a seal<br>
    To privileges venal and mendacious,<br>
    Whereat I often redden and flash with fire.
</p>
<p>
In garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves<br>
    Are seen from here above o’er all the pastures!<br>
    O wrath of God, why dost thou slumber still?
</p>
<p>
To drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons<br>
    Are making ready. O thou good beginning,<br>
    Unto how vile an end must thou needs fall!
</p>
<p>
But the high Providence, that with Scipio<br>
    At Rome the glory of the world defended,<br>
    Will speedily bring aid, as I conceive;
</p>
<p>
And thou, my son, who by thy mortal weight<br>
    Shalt down return again, open thy mouth;<br>
    What I conceal not, do not thou conceal.”
</p>
<p>
As with its frozen vapours downward falls<br>
    In flakes our atmosphere, what time the horn<br>
    Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun,
</p>
<p>
Upward in such array saw I the ether<br>
    Become, and flaked with the triumphant vapours,<br>
    Which there together with us had remained.
</p>
<p>
My sight was following up their semblances,<br>
    And followed till the medium, by excess,<br>
    The passing farther onward took from it;
</p>
<p>
Whereat the Lady, who beheld me freed<br>
    From gazing upward, said to me: “Cast down<br>
    Thy sight, and see how far thou art turned round.”
</p>
<p>
Since the first time that I had downward looked,<br>
    I saw that I had moved through the whole arc<br>
    Which the first climate makes from midst to end;
</p>
<p>
So that I saw the mad track of Ulysses<br>
    Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore<br>
    Whereon became Europa a sweet burden.
</p>
<p>
And of this threshing-floor the site to me<br>
    Were more unveiled, but the sun was proceeding<br>
    Under my feet, a sign and more removed.
</p>
<p>
My mind enamoured, which is dallying<br>
    At all times with my Lady, to bring back<br>
    To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent.
</p>
<p>
And if or Art or Nature has made bait<br>
    To catch the eyes and so possess the mind,<br>
    In human flesh or in its portraiture,
</p>
<p>
All joined together would appear as nought<br>
    To the divine delight which shone upon me<br>
    When to her smiling face I turned me round.
</p>
<p>
The virtue that her look endowed me with<br>
    From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth,<br>
    And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me.
</p>
<p>
Its parts exceeding full of life and lofty<br>
    Are all so uniform, I cannot say<br>
    Which Beatrice selected for my place.
</p>
<p>
But she, who was aware of my desire,<br>
    Began, the while she smiled so joyously<br>
    That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice:
</p>
<p>
“The nature of that motion, which keeps quiet<br>
    The centre and all the rest about it moves,<br>
    From hence begins as from its starting point.
</p>
<p>
And in this heaven there is no other Where<br>
    Than in the Mind Divine, wherein is kindled<br>
    The love that turns it, and the power it rains.
</p>
<p>
Within a circle light and love embrace it,<br>
    Even as this doth the others, and that precinct<br>
    He who encircles it alone controls.
</p>
<p>
Its motion is not by another meted,<br>
    But all the others measured are by this,<br>
    As ten is by the half and by the fifth.
</p>
<p>
And in what manner time in such a pot<br>
    May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves,<br>
    Now unto thee can manifest be made.
</p>
<p>
O Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf<br>
    Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power<br>
    Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves!
</p>
<p>
Full fairly blossoms in mankind the will;<br>
    But the uninterrupted rain converts<br>
    Into abortive wildings the true plums.
</p>
<p>
Fidelity and innocence are found<br>
    Only in children; afterwards they both<br>
    Take flight or e’er the cheeks with down are covered.
</p>
<p>
One, while he prattles still, observes the fasts,<br>
    Who, when his tongue is loosed, forthwith devours<br>
    Whatever food under whatever moon;
</p>
<p>
Another, while he prattles, loves and listens<br>
    Unto his mother, who when speech is perfect<br>
    Forthwith desires to see her in her grave.
</p>
<p>
Even thus is swarthy made the skin so white<br>
    In its first aspect of the daughter fair<br>
    Of him who brings the morn, and leaves the night.
</p>
<p>
Thou, that it may not be a marvel to thee,<br>
    Think that on earth there is no one who governs;<br>
    Whence goes astray the human family.
</p>
<p>
Ere January be unwintered wholly<br>
    By the centesimal on earth neglected,<br>
    Shall these supernal circles roar so loud
</p>
<p>
The tempest that has been so long awaited<br>
    Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows;<br>
    So that the fleet shall run its course direct,
</p>
<p>
And the true fruit shall follow on the flower.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXVIII">
<p>
After the truth against the present life<br>
    Of miserable mortals was unfolded<br>
    By her who doth imparadise my mind,
</p>
<p>
As in a looking-glass a taper’s flame<br>
    He sees who from behind is lighted by it,<br>
    Before he has it in his sight or thought,
</p>
<p>
And turns him round to see if so the glass<br>
    Tell him the truth, and sees that it accords<br>
    Therewith as doth a music with its metre,
</p>
<p>
In similar wise my memory recollecteth<br>
    That I did, looking into those fair eyes,<br>
    Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me.
</p>
<p>
And as I turned me round, and mine were touched<br>
    By that which is apparent in that volume,<br>
    Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,
</p>
<p>
A point beheld I, that was raying out<br>
    Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles<br>
    Must close perforce before such great acuteness.
</p>
<p>
And whatsoever star seems smallest here<br>
    Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.<br>
    As one star with another star is placed.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps at such a distance as appears<br>
    A halo cincturing the light that paints it,<br>
    When densest is the vapour that sustains it,
</p>
<p>
Thus distant round the point a circle of fire<br>
    So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed<br>
    Whatever motion soonest girds the world;
</p>
<p>
And this was by another circumcinct,<br>
    That by a third, the third then by a fourth,<br>
    By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;
</p>
<p>
The seventh followed thereupon in width<br>
    So ample now, that Juno’s messenger<br>
    Entire would be too narrow to contain it.
</p>
<p>
Even so the eighth and ninth; and every one<br>
    More slowly moved, according as it was<br>
    In number distant farther from the first.
</p>
<p>
And that one had its flame most crystalline<br>
    From which less distant was the stainless spark,<br>
    I think because more with its truth imbued.
</p>
<p>
My Lady, who in my anxiety<br>
    Beheld me much perplexed, said: “From that point<br>
    Dependent is the heaven and nature all.
</p>
<p>
Behold that circle most conjoined to it,<br>
    And know thou, that its motion is so swift<br>
    Through burning love whereby it is spurred on.”
</p>
<p>
And I to her: “If the world were arranged<br>
    In the order which I see in yonder wheels,<br>
    What’s set before me would have satisfied me;
</p>
<p>
But in the world of sense we can perceive<br>
    That evermore the circles are diviner<br>
    As they are from the centre more remote
</p>
<p>
Wherefore if my desire is to be ended<br>
    In this miraculous and angelic temple,<br>
    That has for confines only love and light,
</p>
<p>
To hear behoves me still how the example<br>
    And the exemplar go not in one fashion,<br>
    Since for myself in vain I contemplate it.”
</p>
<p>
“If thine own fingers unto such a knot<br>
    Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,<br>
    So hard hath it become for want of trying.”
</p>
<p>
My Lady thus; then said she: “Do thou take<br>
    What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,<br>
    And exercise on that thy subtlety.
</p>
<p>
The circles corporal are wide and narrow<br>
    According to the more or less of virtue<br>
    Which is distributed through all their parts.
</p>
<p>
The greater goodness works the greater weal,<br>
    The greater weal the greater body holds,<br>
    If perfect equally are all its parts.
</p>
<p>
Therefore this one which sweeps along with it<br>
    The universe sublime, doth correspond<br>
    Unto the circle which most loves and knows.
</p>
<p>
On which account, if thou unto the virtue<br>
    Apply thy measure, not to the appearance<br>
    Of substances that unto thee seem round,
</p>
<p>
Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,<br>
    Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,<br>
    In every heaven, with its Intelligence.”
</p>
<p>
Even as remaineth splendid and serene<br>
    The hemisphere of air, when Boreas<br>
    Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,
</p>
<p>
Because is purified and resolved the rack<br>
    That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs<br>
    With all the beauties of its pageantry;
</p>
<p>
Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady<br>
    Had me provided with her clear response,<br>
    And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.
</p>
<p>
And soon as to a stop her words had come,<br>
    Not otherwise does iron scintillate<br>
    When molten, than those circles scintillated.
</p>
<p>
Their coruscation all the sparks repeated,<br>
    And they so many were, their number makes<br>
    More millions than the doubling of the chess.
</p>
<p>
I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir<br>
    To the fixed point which holds them at the ‘Ubi,’<br>
    And ever will, where they have ever been.
</p>
<p>
And she, who saw the dubious meditations<br>
    Within my mind, “The primal circles,” said,<br>
    “Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.
</p>
<p>
Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds,<br>
    To be as like the point as most they can,<br>
    And can as far as they are high in vision.
</p>
<p>
Those other Loves, that round about them go,<br>
    Thrones of the countenance divine are called,<br>
    Because they terminate the primal Triad.
</p>
<p>
And thou shouldst know that they all have delight<br>
    As much as their own vision penetrates<br>
    The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.
</p>
<p>
From this it may be seen how blessedness<br>
    Is founded in the faculty which sees,<br>
    And not in that which loves, and follows next;
</p>
<p>
And of this seeing merit is the measure,<br>
    Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;<br>
    Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.
</p>
<p>
The second Triad, which is germinating<br>
    In such wise in this sempiternal spring,<br>
    That no nocturnal Aries despoils,
</p>
<p>
Perpetually hosanna warbles forth<br>
    With threefold melody, that sounds in three<br>
    Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.
</p>
<p>
The three Divine are in this hierarchy,<br>
    First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;<br>
    And the third order is that of the Powers.
</p>
<p>
Then in the dances twain penultimate<br>
    The Principalities and Archangels wheel;<br>
    The last is wholly of angelic sports.
</p>
<p>
These orders upward all of them are gazing,<br>
    And downward so prevail, that unto God<br>
    They all attracted are and all attract.
</p>
<p>
And Dionysius with so great desire<br>
    To contemplate these Orders set himself,<br>
    He named them and distinguished them as I do.
</p>
<p>
But Gregory afterwards dissented from him;<br>
    Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes<br>
    Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.
</p>
<p>
And if so much of secret truth a mortal<br>
    Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,<br>
    For he who saw it here revealed it to him,
</p>
<p>
With much more of the truth about these circles.”

<p>
At what time both the children of Latona,<br>
    Surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales,<br>
    Together make a zone of the horizon,
</p>
<p>
As long as from the time the zenith holds them<br>
    In equipoise, till from that girdle both<br>
    Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance,
</p>
<p>
So long, her face depicted with a smile,<br>
    Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed<br>
    Fixedly at the point which had o’ercome me.
</p>
<p>
Then she began: “I say, and I ask not<br>
    What thou dost wish to hear, for I have seen it<br>
    Where centres every When and every ‘Ubi.’
</p>
<p>
Not to acquire some good unto himself,<br>
    Which is impossible, but that his splendour<br>
    In its resplendency may say, ‘Subsisto,’
</p>
<p>
In his eternity outside of time,<br>
    Outside all other limits, as it pleased him,<br>
    Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded.
</p>
<p>
Nor as if torpid did he lie before;<br>
    For neither after nor before proceeded<br>
    The going forth of God upon these waters.
</p>
<p>
Matter and Form unmingled and conjoined<br>
    Came into being that had no defect,<br>
    E’en as three arrows from a three-stringed bow.
</p>
<p>
And as in glass, in amber, or in crystal<br>
    A sunbeam flashes so, that from its coming<br>
    To its full being is no interval,
</p>
<p>
So from its Lord did the triform effect<br>
    Ray forth into its being all together,<br>
    Without discrimination of beginning.
</p>
<p>
Order was con-created and constructed<br>
    In substances, and summit of the world<br>
    Were those wherein the pure act was produced.
</p>
<p>
Pure potentiality held the lowest part;<br>
    Midway bound potentiality with act<br>
    Such bond that it shall never be unbound.
</p>
<p>
Jerome has written unto you of angels<br>
    Created a long lapse of centuries<br>
    Or ever yet the other world was made;
</p>
<p>
But written is this truth in many places<br>
    By writers of the Holy Ghost, and thou<br>
    Shalt see it, if thou lookest well thereat.
</p>
<p>
And even reason seeth it somewhat,<br>
    For it would not concede that for so long<br>
    Could be the motors without their perfection.
</p>
<p>
Now dost thou know both where and when these Loves<br>
    Created were, and how; so that extinct<br>
    In thy desire already are three fires.
</p>
<p>
Nor could one reach, in counting, unto twenty<br>
    So swiftly, as a portion of these angels<br>
    Disturbed the subject of your elements.
</p>
<p>
The rest remained, and they began this art<br>
    Which thou discernest, with so great delight<br>
    That never from their circling do they cease.
</p>
<p>
The occasion of the fall was the accursed<br>
    Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen<br>
    By all the burden of the world constrained.
</p>
<p>
Those whom thou here beholdest modest were<br>
    To recognise themselves as of that goodness<br>
    Which made them apt for so much understanding;
</p>
<p>
On which account their vision was exalted<br>
    By the enlightening grace and their own merit,<br>
    So that they have a full and steadfast will.
</p>
<p>
I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,<br>
    ’Tis meritorious to receive this grace,<br>
    According as the affection opens to it.
</p>
<p>
Now round about in this consistory<br>
    Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words<br>
    Be gathered up, without all further aid.
</p>
<p>
But since upon the earth, throughout your schools,<br>
    They teach that such is the angelic nature<br>
    That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,
</p>
<p>
More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed<br>
    The truth that is confounded there below,<br>
    Equivocating in such like prelections.
</p>
<p>
These substances, since in God’s countenance<br>
    They jocund were, turned not away their sight<br>
    From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;
</p>
<p>
Hence they have not their vision intercepted<br>
    By object new, and hence they do not need<br>
    To recollect, through interrupted thought.
</p>
<p>
So that below, not sleeping, people dream,<br>
    Believing they speak truth, and not believing;<br>
    And in the last is greater sin and shame.
</p>
<p>
Below you do not journey by one path<br>
    Philosophising; so transporteth you<br>
    Love of appearance and the thought thereof.
</p>
<p>
And even this above here is endured<br>
    With less disdain, than when is set aside<br>
    The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.
</p>
<p>
They think not there how much of blood it costs<br>
    To sow it in the world, and how he pleases<br>
    Who in humility keeps close to it.
</p>
<p>
Each striveth for appearance, and doth make<br>
    His own inventions; and these treated are<br>
    By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.
</p>
<p>
One sayeth that the moon did backward turn,<br>
    In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself<br>
    So that the sunlight reached not down below;
</p>
<p>
And lies; for of its own accord the light<br>
    Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,<br>
    As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.
</p>
<p>
Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi<br>
    As fables such as these, that every year<br>
    Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,
</p>
<p>
In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,<br>
    Come back from pasture fed upon the wind,<br>
    And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.
</p>
<p>
Christ did not to his first disciples say,<br>
    ‘Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,’<br>
    But unto them a true foundation gave;
</p>
<p>
And this so loudly sounded from their lips,<br>
    That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,<br>
    They made of the Evangel shields and lances.
</p>
<p>
Now men go forth with jests and drolleries<br>
    To preach, and if but well the people laugh,<br>
    The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.
</p>
<p>
But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,<br>
    That, if the common people were to see it,<br>
    They would perceive what pardons they confide in,
</p>
<p>
For which so great on earth has grown the folly,<br>
    That, without proof of any testimony,<br>
    To each indulgence they would flock together.
</p>
<p>
By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,<br>
    And many others, who are worse than pigs,<br>
    Paying in money without mark of coinage.
</p>
<p>
But since we have digressed abundantly,<br>
    Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,<br>
    So that the way be shortened with the time.
</p>
<p>
This nature doth so multiply itself<br>
    In numbers, that there never yet was speech<br>
    Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.
</p>
<p>
And if thou notest that which is revealed<br>
    By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands<br>
    Number determinate is kept concealed.
</p>
<p>
The primal light, that all irradiates it,<br>
    By modes as many is received therein,<br>
    As are the splendours wherewith it is mated.
</p>
<p>
Hence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive<br>
    The affection followeth, of love the sweetness<br>
    Therein diversely fervid is or tepid.
</p>
<p>
The height behold now and the amplitude<br>
    Of the eternal power, since it hath made<br>
    Itself so many mirrors, where ’tis broken,
</p>
<p>
One in itself remaining as before.”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXX">
<p>
Perchance six thousand miles remote from us<br>
    Is glowing the sixth hour, and now this world<br>
    Inclines its shadow almost to a level,
</p>
<p>
When the mid-heaven begins to make itself<br>
    So deep to us, that here and there a star<br>
    Ceases to shine so far down as this depth,
</p>
<p>
And as advances bright exceedingly<br>
    The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed<br>
    Light after light to the most beautiful;
</p>
<p>
Not otherwise the Triumph, which for ever<br>
    Plays round about the point that vanquished me,<br>
    Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,
</p>
<p>
Little by little from my vision faded;<br>
    Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice<br>
    My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.
</p>
<p>
If what has hitherto been said of her<br>
    Were all concluded in a single praise,<br>
    Scant would it be to serve the present turn.
</p>
<p>
Not only does the beauty I beheld<br>
    Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe<br>
    Its Maker only may enjoy it all.
</p>
<p>
Vanquished do I confess me by this passage<br>
    More than by problem of his theme was ever<br>
    O’ercome the comic or the tragic poet;
</p>
<p>
For as the sun the sight that trembles most,<br>
    Even so the memory of that sweet smile<br>
    My mind depriveth of its very self.
</p>
<p>
From the first day that I beheld her face<br>
    In this life, to the moment of this look,<br>
    The sequence of my song has ne’er been severed;
</p>
<p>
But now perforce this sequence must desist<br>
    From following her beauty with my verse,<br>
    As every artist at his uttermost.
</p>
<p>
Such as I leave her to a greater fame<br>
    Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing<br>
    Its arduous matter to a final close,
</p>
<p>
With voice and gesture of a perfect leader<br>
    She recommenced: “We from the greatest body<br>
    Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;
</p>
<p>
Light intellectual replete with love,<br>
    Love of true good replete with ecstasy,<br>
    Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.
</p>
<p>
Here shalt thou see the one host and the other<br>
    Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects<br>
    Which at the final judgment thou shalt see.”
</p>
<p>
Even as a sudden lightning that disperses<br>
    The visual spirits, so that it deprives<br>
    The eye of impress from the strongest objects,
</p>
<p>
Thus round about me flashed a living light,<br>
    And left me swathed around with such a veil<br>
    Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.
</p>
<p>
“Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven<br>
    Welcomes into itself with such salute,<br>
    To make the candle ready for its flame.”
</p>
<p>
No sooner had within me these brief words<br>
    An entrance found, than I perceived myself<br>
    To be uplifted over my own power,
</p>
<p>
And I with vision new rekindled me,<br>
    Such that no light whatever is so pure<br>
    But that mine eyes were fortified against it.
</p>
<p>
And light I saw in fashion of a river<br>
    Fulvid with its effulgence, ’twixt two banks<br>
    Depicted with an admirable Spring.
</p>
<p>
Out of this river issued living sparks,<br>
    And on all sides sank down into the flowers,<br>
    Like unto rubies that are set in gold;
</p>
<p>
And then, as if inebriate with the odours,<br>
    They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,<br>
    And as one entered issued forth another.
</p>
<p>
“The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee<br>
    To have intelligence of what thou seest,<br>
    Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.
</p>
<p>
But of this water it behoves thee drink<br>
    Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.”<br>
    Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;
</p>
<p>
And added: “The river and the topazes<br>
    Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,<br>
    Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;
</p>
<p>
Not that these things are difficult in themselves,<br>
    But the deficiency is on thy side,<br>
    For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.”
</p>
<p>
There is no babe that leaps so suddenly<br>
    With face towards the milk, if he awake<br>
    Much later than his usual custom is,
</p>
<p>
As I did, that I might make better mirrors<br>
    Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave<br>
    Which flows that we therein be better made.
</p>
<p>
And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids<br>
    Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me<br>
    Out of its length to be transformed to round.
</p>
<p>
Then as a folk who have been under masks<br>
    Seem other than before, if they divest<br>
    The semblance not their own they disappeared in,
</p>
<p>
Thus into greater pomp were changed for me<br>
    The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw<br>
    Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.
</p>
<p>
O splendour of God! by means of which I saw<br>
    The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,<br>
    Give me the power to say how it I saw!
</p>
<p>
There is a light above, which visible<br>
    Makes the Creator unto every creature,<br>
    Who only in beholding Him has peace,
</p>
<p>
And it expands itself in circular form<br>
    To such extent, that its circumference<br>
    Would be too large a girdle for the sun.
</p>
<p>
The semblance of it is all made of rays<br>
    Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,<br>
    Which takes therefrom vitality and power.
</p>
<p>
And as a hill in water at its base<br>
    Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty<br>
    When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,
</p>
<p>
So, ranged aloft all round about the light,<br>
    Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand<br>
    All who above there have from us returned.
</p>
<p>
And if the lowest row collect within it<br>
    So great a light, how vast the amplitude<br>
    Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!
</p>
<p>
My vision in the vastness and the height<br>
    Lost not itself, but comprehended all<br>
    The quantity and quality of that gladness.
</p>
<p>
There near and far nor add nor take away;<br>
    For there where God immediately doth govern,<br>
    The natural law in naught is relevant.
</p>
<p>
Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal<br>
    That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour<br>
    Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,
</p>
<p>
As one who silent is and fain would speak,<br>
    Me Beatrice drew on, and said: “Behold<br>
    Of the white stoles how vast the convent is!
</p>
<p>
Behold how vast the circuit of our city!<br>
    Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,<br>
    That here henceforward are few people wanting!
</p>
<p>
On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed<br>
    For the crown’s sake already placed upon it,<br>
    Before thou suppest at this wedding feast
</p>
<p>
Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus<br>
    On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come<br>
    To redress Italy ere she be ready.
</p>
<p>
Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,<br>
    Has made you like unto the little child,<br>
    Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.
</p>
<p>
And in the sacred forum then shall be<br>
    A Prefect such, that openly or covert<br>
    On the same road he will not walk with him.
</p>
<p>
But long of God he will not be endured<br>
    In holy office; he shall be thrust down<br>
    Where Simon Magus is for his deserts,
</p>
<p>
And make him of Alagna lower go!”

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXXI">
<p>
In fashion then as of a snow-white rose<br>
    Displayed itself to me the saintly host,<br>
    Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,
</p>
<p>
But the other host, that flying sees and sings<br>
    The glory of Him who doth enamour it,<br>
    And the goodness that created it so noble,
</p>
<p>
Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers<br>
    One moment, and the next returns again<br>
    To where its labour is to sweetness turned,
</p>
<p>
Sank into the great flower, that is adorned<br>
    With leaves so many, and thence reascended<br>
    To where its love abideth evermore.
</p>
<p>
Their faces had they all of living flame,<br>
    And wings of gold, and all the rest so white<br>
    No snow unto that limit doth attain.
</p>
<p>
From bench to bench, into the flower descending,<br>
    They carried something of the peace and ardour<br>
    Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.
</p>
<p>
Nor did the interposing ’twixt the flower<br>
    And what was o’er it of such plenitude<br>
    Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;
</p>
<p>
Because the light divine so penetrates<br>
    The universe, according to its merit,<br>
    That naught can be an obstacle against it.
</p>
<p>
This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,<br>
    Crowded with ancient people and with modern,<br>
    Unto one mark had all its look and love.
</p>
<p>
O Trinal Light, that in a single star<br>
    Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,<br>
    Look down upon our tempest here below!
</p>
<p>
If the barbarians, coming from some region<br>
    That every day by Helice is covered,<br>
    Revolving with her son whom she delights in,
</p>
<p>
Beholding Rome and all her noble works,<br>
    Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran<br>
    Above all mortal things was eminent,—
</p>
<p>
I who to the divine had from the human,<br>
    From time unto eternity, had come,<br>
    From Florence to a people just and sane,
</p>
<p>
With what amazement must I have been filled!<br>
    Truly between this and the joy, it was<br>
    My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.
</p>
<p>
And as a pilgrim who delighteth him<br>
    In gazing round the temple of his vow,<br>
    And hopes some day to retell how it was,
</p>
<p>
So through the living light my way pursuing<br>
    Directed I mine eyes o’er all the ranks,<br>
    Now up, now down, and now all round about.
</p>
<p>
Faces I saw of charity persuasive,<br>
    Embellished by His light and their own smile,<br>
    And attitudes adorned with every grace.
</p>
<p>
The general form of Paradise already<br>
    My glance had comprehended as a whole,<br>
    In no part hitherto remaining fixed,
</p>
<p>
And round I turned me with rekindled wish<br>
    My Lady to interrogate of things<br>
    Concerning which my mind was in suspense.
</p>
<p>
One thing I meant, another answered me;<br>
    I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw<br>
    An Old Man habited like the glorious people.
</p>
<p>
O’erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks<br>
    With joy benign, in attitude of pity<br>
    As to a tender father is becoming.
</p>
<p>
And “She, where is she?” instantly I said;<br>
    Whence he: “To put an end to thy desire,<br>
    Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.
</p>
<p>
And if thou lookest up to the third round<br>
    Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her<br>
    Upon the throne her merits have assigned her.”
</p>
<p>
Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,<br>
    And saw her, as she made herself a crown<br>
    Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.
</p>
<p>
Not from that region which the highest thunders<br>
    Is any mortal eye so far removed,<br>
    In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,
</p>
<p>
As there from Beatrice my sight; but this<br>
    Was nothing unto me; because her image<br>
    Descended not to me by medium blurred.
</p>
<p>
“O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,<br>
    And who for my salvation didst endure<br>
    In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,
</p>
<p>
Of whatsoever things I have beheld,<br>
    As coming from thy power and from thy goodness<br>
    I recognise the virtue and the grace.
</p>
<p>
Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,<br>
    By all those ways, by all the expedients,<br>
    Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.
</p>
<p>
Preserve towards me thy magnificence,<br>
    So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,<br>
    Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.”
</p>
<p>
Thus I implored; and she, so far away,<br>
    Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;<br>
    Then unto the eternal fountain turned.
</p>
<p>
And said the Old Man holy: “That thou mayst<br>
    Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,<br>
    Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,
</p>
<p>
Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;<br>
    For seeing it will discipline thy sight<br>
    Farther to mount along the ray divine.
</p>
<p>
And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn<br>
    Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,<br>
    Because that I her faithful Bernard am.”
</p>
<p>
As he who peradventure from Croatia<br>
    Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,<br>
    Who through its ancient fame is never sated,
</p>
<p>
But says in thought, the while it is displayed,<br>
    “My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,<br>
    Now was your semblance made like unto this?”
</p>
<p>
Even such was I while gazing at the living<br>
    Charity of the man, who in this world<br>
    By contemplation tasted of that peace.
</p>
<p>
“Thou son of grace, this jocund life,” began he,<br>
    “Will not be known to thee by keeping ever<br>
    Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;
</p>
<p>
But mark the circles to the most remote,<br>
    Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen<br>
    To whom this realm is subject and devoted.”
</p>
<p>
I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn<br>
    The oriental part of the horizon<br>
    Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,
</p>
<p>
Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale<br>
    To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness<br>
    Surpass in splendour all the other front.
</p>
<p>
And even as there where we await the pole<br>
    That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more<br>
    The light, and is on either side diminished,
</p>
<p>
So likewise that pacific oriflamme<br>
    Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side<br>
    In equal measure did the flame abate.
</p>
<p>
And at that centre, with their wings expanded,<br>
    More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,<br>
    Each differing in effulgence and in kind.
</p>
<p>
I saw there at their sports and at their songs<br>
    A beauty smiling, which the gladness was<br>
    Within the eyes of all the other saints;
</p>
<p>
And if I had in speaking as much wealth<br>
    As in imagining, I should not dare<br>
    To attempt the smallest part of its delight.
</p>
<p>
Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes<br>
    Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,<br>
    His own with such affection turned to her
</p>
<p>
That it made mine more ardent to behold.
</p>
</div>
<!--end canto-->

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXXII">
<p>
Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator<br>
    Assumed the willing office of a teacher,<br>
    And gave beginning to these holy words:
</p>
<p>
“The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,<br>
    She at her feet who is so beautiful,<br>
    She is the one who opened it and pierced it.
</p>
<p>
Within that order which the third seats make<br>
    Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,<br>
    With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.
</p>
<p>
Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was<br>
    Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole<br>
    Of the misdeed said, ‘Miserere mei,’
</p>
<p>
Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending<br>
    Down in gradation, as with each one’s name<br>
    I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.
</p>
<p>
And downward from the seventh row, even as<br>
    Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,<br>
    Dividing all the tresses of the flower;
</p>
<p>
Because, according to the view which Faith<br>
    In Christ had taken, these are the partition<br>
    By which the sacred stairways are divided.
</p>
<p>
Upon this side, where perfect is the flower<br>
    With each one of its petals, seated are<br>
    Those who believed in Christ who was to come.
</p>
<p>
Upon the other side, where intersected<br>
    With vacant spaces are the semicircles,<br>
    Are those who looked to Christ already come.
</p>
<p>
And as, upon this side, the glorious seat<br>
    Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats<br>
    Below it, such a great division make,
</p>
<p>
So opposite doth that of the great John,<br>
    Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom<br>
    Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.
</p>
<p>
And under him thus to divide were chosen<br>
    Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,<br>
    And down to us the rest from round to round.
</p>
<p>
Behold now the high providence divine;<br>
    For one and other aspect of the Faith<br>
    In equal measure shall this garden fill.
</p>
<p>
And know that downward from that rank which cleaves<br>
    Midway the sequence of the two divisions,<br>
    Not by their proper merit are they seated;
</p>
<p>
But by another’s under fixed conditions;<br>
    For these are spirits one and all assoiled<br>
    Before they any true election had.
</p>
<p>
Well canst thou recognise it in their faces,<br>
    And also in their voices puerile,<br>
    If thou regard them well and hearken to them.
</p>
<p>
Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;<br>
    But I will loosen for thee the strong bond<br>
    In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.
</p>
<p>
Within the amplitude of this domain<br>
    No casual point can possibly find place,<br>
    No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;
</p>
<p>
For by eternal law has been established<br>
    Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely<br>
    The ring is fitted to the finger here.
</p>
<p>
And therefore are these people, festinate<br>
    Unto true life, not ‘sine causa’ here<br>
    More and less excellent among themselves.
</p>
<p>
The King, by means of whom this realm reposes<br>
    In so great love and in so great delight<br>
    That no will ventureth to ask for more,
</p>
<p>
In his own joyous aspect every mind<br>
    Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace<br>
    Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.
</p>
<p>
And this is clearly and expressly noted<br>
    For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins<br>
    Who in their mother had their anger roused.
</p>
<p>
According to the colour of the hair,<br>
    Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme<br>
    Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.
</p>
<p>
Without, then, any merit of their deeds,<br>
    Stationed are they in different gradations,<br>
    Differing only in their first acuteness.
</p>
<p>
’Tis true that in the early centuries,<br>
    With innocence, to work out their salvation<br>
    Sufficient was the faith of parents only.
</p>
<p>
After the earlier ages were completed,<br>
    Behoved it that the males by circumcision<br>
    Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;
</p>
<p>
But after that the time of grace had come<br>
    Without the baptism absolute of Christ,<br>
    Such innocence below there was retained.
</p>
<p>
Look now into the face that unto Christ<br>
    Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only<br>
    Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.”
</p>
<p>
On her did I behold so great a gladness<br>
    Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds<br>
    Created through that altitude to fly,
</p>
<p>
That whatsoever I had seen before<br>
    Did not suspend me in such admiration,<br>
    Nor show me such similitude of God.
</p>
<p>
And the same Love that first descended there,<br>
    “Ave Maria, gratia plena,” singing,<br>
    In front of her his wings expanded wide.
</p>
<p>
Unto the canticle divine responded<br>
    From every part the court beatified,<br>
    So that each sight became serener for it.
</p>
<p>
“O holy father, who for me endurest<br>
    To be below here, leaving the sweet place<br>
    In which thou sittest by eternal lot,
</p>
<p>
Who is the Angel that with so much joy<br>
    Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,<br>
    Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?”
</p>
<p>
Thus I again recourse had to the teaching<br>
    Of that one who delighted him in Mary<br>
    As doth the star of morning in the sun.
</p>
<p>
And he to me: “Such gallantry and grace<br>
    As there can be in Angel and in soul,<br>
    All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;
</p>
<p>
Because he is the one who bore the palm<br>
    Down unto Mary, when the Son of God<br>
    To take our burden on himself decreed.
</p>
<p>
But now come onward with thine eyes, as I<br>
    Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians<br>
    Of this most just and merciful of empires.
</p>
<p>
Those two that sit above there most enrapture<br>
    As being very near unto Augusta,<br>
    Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.
</p>
<p>
He who upon the left is near her placed<br>
    The father is, by whose audacious taste<br>
    The human species so much bitter tastes.
</p>
<p>
Upon the right thou seest that ancient father<br>
    Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ<br>
    The keys committed of this lovely flower.
</p>
<p>
And he who all the evil days beheld,<br>
    Before his death, of her the beauteous bride<br>
    Who with the spear and with the nails was won,
</p>
<p>
Beside him sits, and by the other rests<br>
    That leader under whom on manna lived<br>
    The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.
</p>
<p>
Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,<br>
    So well content to look upon her daughter,<br>
    Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.
</p>
<p>
And opposite the eldest household father<br>
    Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<br>
    When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.
</p>
<p>
But since the moments of thy vision fly,<br>
    Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor<br>
    Who makes the gown according to his cloth,
</p>
<p>
And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,<br>
    That looking upon Him thou penetrate<br>
    As far as possible through his effulgence.
</p>
<p>
Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,<br>
    Moving thy wings believing to advance,<br>
    By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;
</p>
<p>
Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;<br>
    And thou shalt follow me with thy affection<br>
    That from my words thy heart turn not aside.”
</p>
<p>
And he began this holy orison.

<div class="canto" id="CantoIII.XXXIII">
<p>
“Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,<br>
    Humble and high beyond all other creature,<br>
    The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,
</p>
<p>
Thou art the one who such nobility<br>
    To human nature gave, that its Creator<br>
    Did not disdain to make himself its creature.
</p>
<p>
Within thy womb rekindled was the love,<br>
    By heat of which in the eternal peace<br>
    After such wise this flower has germinated.
</p>
<p>
Here unto us thou art a noonday torch<br>
    Of charity, and below there among mortals<br>
    Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.
</p>
<p>
Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,<br>
    That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,<br>
    His aspirations without wings would fly.
</p>
<p>
Not only thy benignity gives succour<br>
    To him who asketh it, but oftentimes<br>
    Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.
</p>
<p>
In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,<br>
    In thee magnificence; in thee unites<br>
    Whate’er of goodness is in any creature.
</p>
<p>
Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth<br>
    Of the universe as far as here has seen<br>
    One after one the spiritual lives,
</p>
<p>
Supplicate thee through grace for so much power<br>
    That with his eyes he may uplift himself<br>
    Higher towards the uttermost salvation.
</p>
<p>
And I, who never burned for my own seeing<br>
    More than I do for his, all of my prayers<br>
    Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,
</p>
<p>
That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud<br>
    Of his mortality so with thy prayers,<br>
    That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.
</p>
<p>
Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst<br>
    Whate’er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve<br>
    After so great a vision his affections.
</p>
<p>
Let thy protection conquer human movements;<br>
    See Beatrice and all the blessed ones<br>
    My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!”
</p>
<p>
The eyes beloved and revered of God,<br>
    Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us<br>
    How grateful unto her are prayers devout;
</p>
<p>
Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,<br>
    On which it is not credible could be<br>
    By any creature bent an eye so clear.
</p>
<p>
And I, who to the end of all desires<br>
    Was now approaching, even as I ought<br>
    The ardour of desire within me ended.
</p>
<p>
Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,<br>
    That I should upward look; but I already<br>
    Was of my own accord such as he wished;
</p>
<p>
Because my sight, becoming purified,<br>
    Was entering more and more into the ray<br>
    Of the High Light which of itself is true.
</p>
<p>
From that time forward what I saw was greater<br>
    Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,<br>
    And yields the memory unto such excess.
</p>
<p>
Even as he is who seeth in a dream,<br>
    And after dreaming the imprinted passion<br>
    Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,
</p>
<p>
Even such am I, for almost utterly<br>
    Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet<br>
    Within my heart the sweetness born of it;
</p>
<p>
Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,<br>
    Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves<br>
    Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.
</p>
<p>
O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee<br>
    From the conceits of mortals, to my mind<br>
    Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,
</p>
<p>
And make my tongue of so great puissance,<br>
    That but a single sparkle of thy glory<br>
    It may bequeath unto the future people;
</p>
<p>
For by returning to my memory somewhat,<br>
    And by a little sounding in these verses,<br>
    More of thy victory shall be conceived!
</p>
<p>
I think the keenness of the living ray<br>
    Which I endured would have bewildered me,<br>
    If but mine eyes had been averted from it;
</p>
<p>
And I remember that I was more bold<br>
    On this account to bear, so that I joined<br>
    My aspect with the Glory Infinite.
</p>
<p>
O grace abundant, by which I presumed<br>
    To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,<br>
    So that the seeing I consumed therein!
</p>
<p>
I saw that in its depth far down is lying<br>
    Bound up with love together in one volume,<br>
    What through the universe in leaves is scattered;
</p>
<p>
Substance, and accident, and their operations,<br>
    All interfused together in such wise<br>
    That what I speak of is one simple light.
</p>
<p>
The universal fashion of this knot<br>
    Methinks I saw, since more abundantly<br>
    In saying this I feel that I rejoice.
</p>
<p>
One moment is more lethargy to me,<br>
    Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise<br>
    That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!
</p>
<p>
My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,<br>
    Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,<br>
    And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.
</p>
<p>
In presence of that light one such becomes,<br>
    That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect<br>
    It is impossible he e’er consent;
</p>
<p>
Because the good, which object is of will,<br>
    Is gathered all in this, and out of it<br>
    That is defective which is perfect there.
</p>
<p>
Shorter henceforward will my language fall<br>
    Of what I yet remember, than an infant’s<br>
    Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.
</p>
<p>
Not because more than one unmingled semblance<br>
    Was in the living light on which I looked,<br>
    For it is always what it was before;
</p>
<p>
But through the sight, that fortified itself<br>
    In me by looking, one appearance only<br>
    To me was ever changing as I changed.
</p>
<p>
Within the deep and luminous subsistence<br>
    Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<br>
    Of threefold colour and of one dimension,
</p>
<p>
And by the second seemed the first reflected<br>
    As Iris is by Iris, and the third<br>
    Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.
</p>
<p>
O how all speech is feeble and falls short<br>
    Of my conceit, and this to what I saw<br>
    Is such, ’tis not enough to call it little!
</p>
<p>
O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,<br>
    Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself<br>
    And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!
</p>
<p>
That circulation, which being thus conceived<br>
    Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<br>
    When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,
</p>
<p>
Within itself, of its own very colour<br>
    Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<br>
    Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.
</p>
<p>
As the geometrician, who endeavours<br>
    To square the circle, and discovers not,<br>
    By taking thought, the principle he wants,
</p>
<p>
Even such was I at that new apparition;<br>
    I wished to see how the image to the circle<br>
    Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;
</p>
<p>
But my own wings were not enough for this,<br>
    Had it not been that then my mind there smote<br>
    A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.
</p>
<p>
Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:<br>
    But now was turning my desire and will,<br>
    Even as a wheel that equally is moved,
</p>
<p>
The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.
